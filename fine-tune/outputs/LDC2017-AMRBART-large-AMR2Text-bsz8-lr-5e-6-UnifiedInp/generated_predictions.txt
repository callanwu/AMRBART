 Resolutely support the person who started the thread, and I will reply with a poem of my own.
 Pledge to fight to defend the Diaoyu Islands and related islands by death.
 A fishing boat bumped into the fleet. The evil little Japanese ghost stirred up trouble and unrest. Again, with a thief's heart and a form of arrogance, they showed their wolfish appearance.
 Never go back to that time when we made a humiliating appearance when we signed the treaty. China is strong! Sword and knife are sharp and shining! Let's bury the approaching enemy!

 I agree with the analysis of the thread starter. If war really comes, I would like to be Hua Mulan to protect our home and defend our homeland, to spread the prestige of our country, and to pledge to fight to the death for the defense of our national dignity. Bump up resolutely!
 I very much wish that I had been born during Mao Zedong's passionate and upsurge Long March, so that I would lose my head, shed my blood, completely extinguish all the wrongdoers and enemies of China, and spread our dragon prestige.
 How long were we going to tolerate Japan?
 I say to my fellow citizens....
 Hello everyone! We all know about the September 18th incident, but now again, as we all know, Japan has premeditated and premeditated another incident on the sea, the Lugou Bridge incident.
 Japan surprisingly defied the strong condemnation of the whole world and openly invaded our country's sacred territory, the Diaoyu Islands.
 As we all know, the Diaoyu Islands have always belonged to China. For historical reasons, it is for historical reasons that our original belonging has become a controversy.
 My fellow citizens, our things were what we were and why was there a need for negotiations, that's why Japan went even further, she wanted to create the fact of occupation, can we allow this? Absolutely not.
 My fellow citizens, Japan's militarism brought grave disaster to the Asian people.
 Especially China, which suffered from Japanese ravages for several decades and years.
 In the Northeast, Japanese Unit 731 carried out cruel human body experiments with extremely brutal methods on Chinese, Korean, and other living people with extremely brutal methods in the Northeast. The Nanjing Massacre added a layer of blood that would never fade away from the ancient capital. The big bloody battles in Hengyang and Changsha bare the bones of the dead for over 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) and killed off everything.
 My fellow citizens, there are too many instances (listed, difficult to record without all the bamboo strips being exhausted) of heinous crimes committed by Japan in China, which were committed by Japan in China.
 Just as those 10 million deceased souls who lost their lives wandered over the Pacific Ocean and found it difficult to rest in peace.
 Therefore, all those who experienced that era still have vivid memories of it. Every time we turn this page of history and read it, even our younger generation also cried with tears streaming down our cheek, and our blood boiled with indignation.
 Now that Japan actually wants to reverse the verdict of the history of its aggression, it will wake up fellow citizens and Chinese people in Asia.
 Although it is painful for us to look back at this shameful 100 years of history, we have to go on facing it, it is painful for us to look back at this shameful 100 years of history, but regardless of the historical issues, let's create and choose history.
 Because of responsibility, we are not afraid. Even though the territory is small, it is a matter of dignity. The interests of the country and the national unity are a guarantee of honor, no matter how the wind and clouds change. We can not let our native land be separated even if it is scarred and wounded.
 My fellow citizens, the advent of the 21st century means that the Chinese nation is a time when we are beset by difficulties on the inside but pressed from the outside, and we face many challenges.
 How should we go about the Taiwan issue, the Tibet issue, the South China Sea issue, the surrounding environment, or an aggressive foreign force to China?
 Fellow Citizens, please look at the world map, the crescent-shaped encirclement is suppressing our breath, strangling our development, and coveting our national territory.
 We didn't want to make enemies, but we didn't want to make enemies either. We didn't want war, but we weren't afraid of war. We never were.
 We must urgently arrange arms and strengthen all military forces on land, sea and air.
 The Chinese nation has been flourishing for several thousand years, but it has never had the ambition to expand its territory outward as before.
 We follow a strategy philosophy of foreign security that applies benevolence and virtue, not wanting to impose our wants on others.
 The tolerance and liberalness of the country is similar to the tolerance and liberalness of the individual, we must insist on not hurting others, but avoid hurting others.
 Tolerance is certainly not fear, and sincerity does not have to be cowardice.
 China 's exemption from Japanese war repairs after World War II served as a peace of benevolence .
 My fellow citizens , the People 's Heroes Monument is a condense history of a Chinese nation striving for continuous improvement .
 The solemn and magnificent posture represented a sacred expectation of peace .
 My memory strings of thoughts are occasionally agitated by the stirring up in my mind of many heroic, tragic and stirring scenes of shining spears and armored horses.
 My thoughts go through those yellowed historical pages like I saw Kangxi , a famous generation-old ruler who was alone in his audience hall 100 years ago , contemplateing how to achieve the unification of the territories , and also Abraham Lincoln , a former U.S. president who wandered alone in the dark of the great hall , thinking about the integrity of the Union .
 Forgetting about war is certainly dangerous, but it is a dangerous thing to forget about peace in the world. My fellow citizens, if we want development and peace, we must never exercise forbearance blind, but the Boxer Protocol of betrayal and humiliation of the nation aggravated China's poverty and backwardness in modern times. To fall behind would lead to bullying.
 Where does peace come from without strength?
 We must focus on national defense education, build a great wall in the heart of 1.3 billion people, and establish a full-range defense system capable of attacking and defending the nation.
 On the premise of avoiding influences on national economic development, the best defense is attack defense. We should strengthen the force that can engage in ultra-long-range attack, improve combat capability in all aerospace at great distances and depths, increase defense industry investment and construction, accelerate the modernization and internationalization of military equipment, and establish elite high quality high-tech divisions.
 The battle horn is about to sound, people are already fully equipped and ready to go.
 We accomplished nothing without the support of the people, but we are all powerful with the support of the people.
 It's time for us to say "no" to other people, my fellow citizens, it's time for us to say "no" to other people, that's what we have to achieve.
 1 . Establishing guaranteed funds , improving the work environment and work mechanism , and recruiting back into China the hundreds of thousands of information technology professionals who have emigrated from the United States and around the world and have lingeried in the United States and around the world into China .
 2) Create a few battle groups of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.
 3,000 advanced combat aircraft of various kinds of various kinds will be manufactured.
 4. Advancing research and deployment of high-speed intercontinental ballistic missiles with a range of more than 10,000 nautical miles (22,000 kilometers) that could break the missile defense system's defenses.
 5. Resumption of nuclear experimentation and establishment of military forces in space.
 6) retain 1000 nuclear bombs equal to 1 million tons of TNT and install nuclear warheads on all short and middle-range missiles when necessary.
 7. Retaining 30 strategic nuclear submarines capable of inflicting 3 devastating nuclear strikes on the enemy.
 8. Abandon your commitment to not using nuclear weapons for the first time.
 9. The right to pre-emptive strike is retained in the event of a threat to national security.
 My fellow citizens! Qin Shi Huang unified China! Zheng Chenggong recovered Taiwan! We must carry on carrying on the far - seeing, insight and strong will of our predecessors! It is our responsibility! Only with confidence and improvement can we strive to be strong!
 Now those pieces of land that tremble far from the embrace of the motherland are shaking, moaning and calling. Fellow citizens, let us carry forward, moving forward courageously, carrying forward the wishes of previous generals that were not fulfilled, carrying forward the wishes of previous generals!
 When I read history, the heaviness and anger in my heart simmered into national concern. Having been born to a cloth gown and being one of the common people, even if I die, I am willing to voluntarily serve our country in order for the prosperity of the motherland and for it to be splendid once again, and I have no regrets even if I die. My sincere and patriotic heart is adequate to show heaven.
 Here I compose poems in the classical form of Ci to voice the aspirations of my heart .
 Paint a deep red lip.
 Protect the Diaoyu Islands!
 We bitterly lost our Ryukyu Islands.
 How can we allow the Diaoyu Islands to fall to other countries?
 100 years of vicissitude.
 The smoke and clouds were chasing the flying waves.
 The youngest brother is still a tender youth.
 It wandered off in all directions , bearing a seal .
 Look over at the flag.
 We brandished our weapons and crossed to the east.
 Let the horses have a drink in the Pacific Ocean.

" Ban Ki-moon presenting a bouquet in Hiroshima, my brother and sister, how strong is the brother and sister, how strong is the brother and sister, if it is a wealthy country or a strong person, if it is a strong country or a strong person, if it is a wealthy country or a strong person, if it is a strong person, then there will be more history to be more history to be made of.
 Why didn't we fight the little Japan?
 What are the Chinese still going to tolerate?
 They even ride on our heads.
 Are the gutless Chinese still doing this?
 We should tell the whole world that others cannot bully China at will.
 It is time for us to show our strength. China has been calm for too long.
 Currently, all our citizens' lives are too carefree, the officials are too extravagant.
 We already have no cohesion now. China needs to start a war. A harsh slap in the face for countries that follow the United States' rear.
 Let them know that the US is not a panacea; if we win, it may increase the influence of China; if we lose, it may improve citizen cohesion; if we lose, we can clean out incompetent bureaucrats and make the trash get out; if we lose, let China have new blood and update, let China get up.
 Go China!
 I suggest that China strengthen its guard of the Diaoyu Islands, guard the Diaoyu Islands daily, protect the fishermen and sovereignty of our country, and if Japan dares to invade our territory with military force, we will fight a small-scale war in order to defend ourselves, no matter what the cost. China cannot lose.
 We need shows in life, but to show you being embraced by someone is really p.m.
 I was just passing by.
 The whole society, including the stars, is like this.
 Damn, not sexy.
 It is totally unacceptable.
 Agreed, just a cheap entertainer, their rep in feudal China makes somewhat sense.
 Their lives look glorious.
 A group of 9 professions.
 Life is hard.
 Shocking.
 That's normal. And a whore is heartless and a performer is not always righteous.
 They want the money, not the face.
 Look at the wolf near Ms. Fan's glasses - you know the actors have to drink with him, without being forced out or even framed.
 SOB.
 As long as there is something to eat, that is, as long as it is edible.
 No one is easy, life is like a show, you have to look at the script to know how the performance is going.
 All of them.
 In all 360 walks of life, there are people who top the Imperial Examination top score. The effort and endeavor behind those who top the Imperial Examination top score is so great! This humiliates the word bean vermicelli!
 haha.
 Overdoing it.
 Reality.
 shoot those hooligans.
 A cheap performer.
 A cheap performer.
 The entertainment circle is dirty. All the men in it are birds, beasts and scum.
 Pity they're dead, but who's to blame? Not easy to be a female star.
 Everybody does this, how can you make money if you don't do this?
 When women are in front of other people , they are proud , but when they are alone , they are in a melancholy mood .
 To put it simply, nowadays's stars are just popular prostitutes: in ancient times, they were just popular prostitutes; now, since they are famous famous prostitutes, it is just normal for them to drink with or even sleep with some high officials.
 Stop talking to yourself, just behave yourself.
 What should we do in the future? The ability alone is not enough for success. Should we face such hard choices too?
 More suffering, more suffering disguised as a glorious look, is indisputible.
 It's not so bad because they're just playing in their own circles, out of sight and out of mind.
 However, there was an old guy, Zhang Jizhong, an old guy who was a hooligan in his own circles, who also behaved like a hooligan in his own circles, and who thought himself to be unselfishly virtuous. When he had nothing to do, he made a television series to wreck the people of the whole country.
 Both are taking what they need.
 When was China able to have pure and innocent girls?
 The story is now very shocking in the entertainment world. There are rumors that Hsu Yuki was forced out because he refused to drink with the guests as arranged by the company, and had to switch to working as a lawyer 's assistant instead to make the end meet .
 Often, the much admired and star-crossed superpowers encounter social engagements or circumstances that they don't welcome but have to join in.
 After all, they can't make many decisions because they must have many aspects and interests of many people in mind.
 Sometimes the very normal dinner parties that seem so normal to us ordinary people can not be that simple for the stars , as we imagine them to be .
 The star has a lot of contracts and if she tackles well her money source will roll in. If she doesn't tack well the force of being forced out or even framed will come off her heels if she doesn't tack well.
 The two kinds of smart female stars are those of the first kind who always hold very high integrity and sternly reject all such invitations.
 The second kind of person is the one who is good at playing tricks and achieving their objectives with their own seed money.
 There are rumors that even some super-f female stars have won their first roles this way.
 After drinking some alcohol, an advertiser or show sponsor may have the chance to lie on the star's shoulder, feel her chin, or kiss her cheek, and after the star has drank some alcohol, she most likely will adopt a endure attitude.
 They are the very people in the lower 9 professions.
 Those stars are just pretending and actually living much better lives than this!
 Agreed, just a cheap entertainer, their rep in feudal China makes somewhat sense.
 Agreed.
 Oh well, actors aren't easy.
 They deserve it, they asked for that.
 It dawned on me that nothing would be easy.
 Women are birds and beasts, and men are worse than birds and beasts.
 braawwk
 braawwkkk
 It won't take long.
 In late 2004, Route 288, which runs around the southwest quadrant of the Richmond New Urban Region, was opened as a circumference highway.
 It has already changed the development pattern by making it worse, and caused localised traffic congestion around its exits.
 Today, the Richmond Times-Dispatch tells the tale of the impact of the Huguenot Trail in Powhatan County.
 Will Jones reported that traffic on one section of the Huguenot Trail has more than doubled since 288 opened.
 There was a surge in speed and accidents as well.
 So far this year, 17 accidents have been reported near the intersection of Winterfield Road, up from 12 in all of 2004.
 resident engineer Dale Totten of the Virginia Department of Transportation noted that if the department had more money , it would have four road lanes at a cost of about 13 million dollars .
 Of course, VDOT does not have the money to construct roads in the Richmond region.
 Because VDOT spent all that frigging money from local politicians and boosters to spend on 288.
 Where is Homer Simpson when you need him?
 This is a major moment, doh.
 As we predicted , Route 288 will generate residential development in all the areas around its exit , overtaxing the local roads of the country .
 Others choose where to work and live while the limited access highways can relieve traffic for drivers driving back and forth between Chesterfield County and Goochland County.
 And they create traffic congestion in new places.
 I am surprised that this is only rapid.
 Even I think 3 or 4 years could be lagging behind.
 Think about the liability that Route 288 would have created for all of its exits, just this one of these just because Route 288 has already created 13 million dollars in road construction already.
 Another prediction.
 After a few more years of scattered development of subdivisions and the approval of a mega - commercial project at the intersection of major roads on 288 , the need for new road improvements soared .
 We could well see the unfunded liabilities zoom past the $400 million originally taken to build the original highway before the end of the decade.
 said a brainiac who thinks Route 288 is such a great idea.
 Thank you for nothing.
 I think we could have spent the $400 million elsewhere better.
 I don't think you should blame 288 for creating those people.
 If there are enough of them to create traffic congestion in new places, what are the alternatives?
 additional traffic congestion in the old place?
 Now you understand how people like TMT in Fairfax feel.
 I usually take a pro-road position.
 But 288 is definitely in definite excess, with glaring needs in other parts of the state.
 Richmond has virtually no traffic.
 The rush hour hour is 30 minutes.
 And you give them a beltway through a large rural area.
 Road to nowhere.
 Just think how much of this money could be spent on another Potomac crossing facility or road improvements desperately needed in NOVA.
 @Virginia Centrist, To add insult to injury, the rest of the state helped to pay for 288 during the budget deal last year, so that helped wipe out the debt.
 Very nice of you all to oblige us.
 Not much sense, though.
 It's the same old problem.
 If you get ahead of the need, you get accused of sprawl.
 It is claimed that if you build in a place where the need is already acute, you cannot pave your way out of congestion.
 Anonymous.
 That's the fair point.
 5:26 makes a good point.
 But this situation has hammered home the validity of a state audit report that found that the CTB and VDOT were funding transportation projects based on the best interests of the best lobbyists rather than on a comprehensive transportation plan for the state.
 I submit this is a disgraceful situation that should not be tolerated.
 And Senator Chichester and his toadies are pouring more money into these flawed institutions and making this worse.
 What is the point of transportation expenses?
 In Virginia, it was for the benefit of the private business plan and not in the service of the public interest.
 You're all dead wrong.
 No less than Walter Stosch stated that the intention is to pay for economic development money through the payment of 288.
 C'mon folks...
 I don't understand your point, TMT.
 When was the last time you got stuck in traffic when you were in or from some sort of business?
 The whole point of the road seems to me to be to facilitate the public's interest in getting into and out of private businesses.
 There is an overwhelming need for business support, even if it is of course a Sunday drive and a trip to the grandmothers location and a soccer game.
 No wonder we suffer from congested roads, since our road expenditures do not match the increase in business or state GDP.
 If we recognize that the primary business benefit of the road is business, then we should do two things:
 Of course businesses will pay more for their own transportation bills (of course they will) and even if this means more travel overall, we will incentive them to locate themselves where they are least stressful to the system.
 Why is it so hard to understand?
 Solving the functioning human settlement pattern and balancing the capacity of the transport system with the travel demand generated by the use of land will be the solution .
 spinning all else.
 EMR
 TMT: In Virginia it was for the benefit of private business plans and not in the service of the public interest.
 I don't see the point of this statement, as it appears to demonize private business plans and put the public interest above all else.
 I think they are tightly intertwined so they are virtually the same person.
 Obviously there is a local problem as these cookie doughs are lumpy.
 But in aggregate, if we demonize business long enough, we will eventually find ourselves all working with the devil.
 I don't see the point in claiming a solution to a balance that has an ever changing dynamic nature.
 Even you have seen the positives of the rail to Dulles, it is a job center that will promote bidirectional rail demand.
 I agree.
 In fact, that may be all the reason it was built for, all on its own.
 All I'm saying is that the exact same logic should apply to the road.
 They should have a destination at both ends so that we can use our investments to the maximum.
 We need more places to get closer to the balance that you say we need to get to.
 Reality checks here.
 I drive past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.
 I commute back and forth to work along the Huguenot trail,
 I've never seen anything remotely like a traffic flood.
 It's a 55-mile zone where every morning there are 75-100 cars in the zone.
 The Huguenot Trail is already planned to be widened because of heavy demand from development on the Chesterfield side, new schools, and a whole bunch of existing development that was zoned and funneled through Robious Road years ago.
 288 would be wonderful for those of us who actually use it, rather than Powhatan and western Chesterfield being bottlenecked by their lack of roads.
 We can develop our commercial development and work closer to where we live.
 You might think that is irrational use of land.
 I have no desire to live in any city.
 I refuse to work in the downtown area.
 I refuse to use mass transit which is unsafe for female commuters who work at irregular and irregular hours.
 And I seem to like the development of large lots.
 I don't understand exactly how I'm supposed to keep a horse on a 1/4 acre lot.
 One gallon of gas can go for $10.
 And I'm still paying to live in the country.
 Many people have a legitimate preference for horses, hunting, gardens, and certain types of small businesses, which makes them not want to live in the urban core.
 I am truly baffled by this infatuation with city life.
 Anonymous 6:37, If you wish to live in the country, you have every right to.
 But you have no right to have the rest of the state underwrite the construction of a $400 million highway to make shopping and getting to work easier.
 Anything else that could be spent $400 million has been consistently overlooked in the 288 debate.
 If the money is applied to other pressing road projects, or even (god forbid) non-road road projects, much traffic congestion can be alleviated.
 Ray Hyde, my comment was directed at the investors who lobbied to have the road placed near their property, and the incompetent system that funded this request whether it was linked to a master transportation plan or not.
 I'm 24, and I'm a mother of 2.5 children.
 I've been breaking up with my son's father since August.
 I want to start dating other people, and my son's father says he has nothing to do with it if I do.
 He is very possessive and controlling but with us together he has no right to be.
 There's too much going on in his life right now and although I've told him several times that I don't love him and he doesn't love me, he thinks we can work together.
 I want him there for his son without needing me too.
 But he has no one, his family doesn't get along with his family and they have their own issues.
 I don't want to be miserable anymore and if he's around longer I'll be more miserable.
 I don't want him not there for his son because he was a good father or at least tried to be.
 I believe every child needs both parents, whether they be together or not.
 But he thinks no one can have me if he can't have me.
 What have I done with my life to move on?
 It's very bad that your ex threatens you by using your son.
 You have to not give in to that, because if you do it will just escalate it.
 You have the right to live your life and be happy, not to cave under his threats.
 If he really does love his son, he will see him regardless, but this is just a typical control method that people like him use.
 Other people have said things like "If you leave me, I'll kill you" - did it get through to you?
 Time to date.
 Meet all kinds of people.
 Do what you want.
 If it were at the price of him voluntarily walking out of both of your lives you would probably be better off without him.
 I agree, but there's one other thing, it's not his business whether you're married or not.
 I didn't tell him.
 Not because he's a threat, but because he's not about your personal life.
 Can you document his threats?
 You really need to.
 Quit taking his calls and make him leave a voice mail.
 Make him email or text you.
 Keep that record.
 Get a lawyer and divorce.
 If you can't afford one, try legal aid.
 Tell your ex - boyfriend that all communication needs to go through a lawyer.
 The bus driver, the person at the till, the person delivering your food, wants exact change.
 Are they not aware that you don't get a pile of change in the bank?
 Would someone have to take a note somewhere?
 People get lazy.
 I like to be near as near as possible because I don't like counting copper all day long.
 If you take a £20 note on the bus they will just tell you to get off because they are hella lazy.
 It is illegal to pay a certain amount in a load of coins, for example you can only pay something like £30 for a pence, it is illegal.
 Hello, I started university in September but obviously like most people, I didn't immediately gel with it.
 I know it will take me some time to adjust though, as I'm a very introvert, shy, anxious, and always anxious, especially compared to the rest of the rest, but it will take some time.
 It was the first night I've been here that all my housemates and I went out together and it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
 When I was sober up, I went to a student union bar on my own.
 But more to the point. Here's the fact.
 After being here for about 5 months, I'm not enjoying the university. I'm disillusioned by the course, I'm not enjoying the set-up projects, and I don't like the course delivery much.
 The university is made to be much better than it seems it is.
 I started the first term badly. In addition to the level of stress, the delay in financing the students and the fact that I was so worried that I was unable to make progress in work due to all the piling up, concluded that...
 I was assigned a counsellor at uni and I saw him for about 5-6 weeks in block sessions, to be honest it didn't really work out because I never opened up to him.
 Only half hearted.
 Now I'm loaded with work on my shoulders, I have to hit major deadlines, I'm depressed, and the anxiety results in me feeling miserable all the time.
 I no longer have a counsellor because you can only have one at a time, and I doubt he would have helped me much this time if he hadn't already helped me.
 I lack motivation, I don't feel comfortable with my lecturers, I feel like I want to give up, but can't bring myself to do so because I ended up with a dead end job and I'm looking for someone.
 I would rather die than be uneducated and not live the life I want to and make matters worse by dropping out of uni.
 I'm 21, I'm turning 22 this year, I don't have much time left to fail, I have to do something.
 I failed college once, and had to do another course so I could get into uni, I didn't want to go through the system over and over again and fail consistently.
 Can someone give me some advice?
 Maybe go and see your doctor and see if there is any way you can get him to extend your deadline to try and ease the pressure a bit.
 Send your tutor an email like this post and he/she will consider the mitigating circumstances. Don't worry, they have seen all of the admitted's before, some of whom are much more uncomfortable, I know as I used to work in the University administration department.
 Break up your work into chunks you can manage.
 concentrate on one bit of work at a time, the obvious first and most urgent assignment.
 Don't shut off your housemate and do well, you're trying new things from the very beginning, keep it up now.
 You should go see your doctor, too.
 You might benefit from speaking to someone if you were always an anxious person, my friend gets therapy on the NHS due to anxiety so it's really normal for you.
 And if you're being honest, try and get the deadline extended, I'm sure your university will allow it.
 Keep strong and keep carrying on with life gets hard.
 My mum divorced, she had a horrible time with my stepfather and was sent round the bend by the new freedom she found.
 She is epilepsy and manic depression with a huge anger problem.
 She is constantly horrible to me.
 When I'm at home I can't cope with her outbursts and nasty remarks.
 I'm 18, at breaking point, a 95% bursary student, full time at a high pressure private school in 6th form, with 95% bursaries.
 I can't work at home because she shouts at me.
 Then I got angry with my teacher.
 One minute she was lovely, like I had my mummy back, and then the next minute she turned into the most spiteful human on earth to live.
 I didn't pass my A2 and I've already accepted defeat and the fact that this year of my life has made me fail.
 Who knows, maybe I can come back to this. The university offered me the most amazing offer, but I couldn't even accept it. I've never made a grade.
 I wish I could wipe her out of my life, things would be so much better without her.
 But then I thought I was just being selfish.
 But surely it wasn't meant to be like this, was it?
 It should have been so much better.
 But I'm feeling like I'm not in control of this downhill spiral.
 And I don't know what to do.
 Thanks for reading.
 Nice vent.
 You can't get her section for that.
 Did she even have a history of mental illness or diagnosis?
 You sure didn't know you wouldn't get a good grade, so if you could, you'd accept a place if you could.
 Life throws things at you all the time.
 An outsider is someone who is not part of your family.
 I had to deal with verbal abuse from my dad for 8 years before I came to uni and honestly, the only reason I'm here is because it's the only way out.
 If you really want out, you work hard.
 It really sounds like you need support from somewhere else if she can't give you it consistently.
 Can you call Childline or something like that?
 You can go to the library on Saturday and study for a good 8 hours.
 Can you go to a friend's house to form a study group?
 You want her sectioned because it's a bit of pain in the arse and you blame it on all your problems?
 I know how you feel.
 My mum was spanked out of hell too.
 I highly recommend taking up smoking.
 Oh, tsr grew up and stopped nagging, it's a joke.
 I think in the past year or two I've become a much weaker person and in a way I've dulled down my personality down to try and make some friends at uni.
 But being over nice leads people to believe they can say or do whatever the hell they want to me.
 They are showing absolutely no respect.
 For example, I say hello to someone from uni and they ignore me, then 30 minutes later they decide they want to help me with some work and I give them some help.
 It caused a lot of anger and distress in my life and really started to affect my concentration at university.
 Has anyone got any experience with handling this sort of thing, or how to go about gaining some respect again?
 You just said no.
 If it isn't particularly comfortable for you, do it gradually.
 You might start by saying "I'm sorry, but I'm busy.
 Of course you aren't going to go over the top with it, but don't go in the completely opposite direction.
 If you think no, in your mind, you say no.
 They start to respect you more when they start to realise you don't bend over backwards for them.
 Well this is really such a bad attitude, of course if you're not nice, but just not nice enough to let them do anything to you, that's not nice, but that's not a fool's attitude.
 I don't know if anyone has read this, but I'm just feeling desperate and feel the need to tell someone.
 I left home in September and started at uni, I was incredibly anxious to do this but delayed thinking about it until I got here, now I'm here and have been for over 2 weeks. I feel terribly overwhelmed by it all and feel unconfident and socially awkward.
 I've been in an emotional struggle the majority of my life, since I moved to secondary school I've been struggling emotionally, I lost my dad around the age of 9 and I've always blamed it for my feelings. I've had two periods of counselling in my life, from December 2009 until around March this year, roughly 15 months.
 At the moment, I feel like the problems in my life are insurmountable, and I am making myself ever more doubtful of my always low self esteem, I am unable to concentrate on work, often find myself very quiet on social occasions, and I am doubtful of anything and everything.
 I have not been diagnosed by my 2 counselling counsellors as having depression and they have suggested I don't suffer from it, but it is a huge worry for me because of the depression that caused my dad to die by suicide.
 I've tried to solve my problems before and found exercise and meditation particularly useful, and have also tried things like self-help books and tapes, but I generally feel that this is what I am living through, wasting my one chance to exist and my one chance to be a young man, and these feelings beat away at me.
 I simply don't know what to do and never follow through when I think of what to do, my friends often say I'm lazy and I can't disagree a lot of the time, I feel like people are trying everything anyone can do to help and I fail time and time again.
 Sorry to anyone reading this jumbled mess, I'm feeling a bit like a self-seeking moaner, but I'm truly feeling desperate.
 It is common for people's existing feelings to become more intense when they are in a new situation and feel under pressure to socialize with strangers and fit into new roles (such as university students).
 I am not a health professional and can only speak from my own personal experience, so I strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional about your feelings and worries about depression.
 Most people feel unconfident and awkward when they first get to uni, so you're definitely not alone there, but I really recommend you get an appointment with your uni counselling service, you obviously have some problems at the minute and could use some support. It really doesn't matter if anyone tells you that you're depressed or not, it only makes you feel worse, the label is not as important as what you experience, meditate and exercise is really helpful so try to do both, but you need to engage with help and general life to get somewhere, not beat yourself up because you feel no motivation to do anything at the minute, a lot of people feel like this and hopefully it will pass when you begin to feel better. Be kind to yourself and get some help.
 Good luck.
 I think a lot of people feel the same way as you do but medicate themselves by using friends, it's probably not a solution as such but when you're depressed it's definitely better to be around your friends than to be alone and depressed. Either way, feel free to make a private message to me if you fancy chatting.
 If I were you, I would focus on the idols, you would aspire to someone like someone who came from a bad background and ended up successful, happy, had a family, married, etc. You don't want to be them, but someone you admire and respect.
 focus on what you have achieved in life, do not state what you studied or indeed why you studied, do you want to experience, do you want to go, does your mum want you to go, do you need a degree for a career you want to have?
 Either way, sum up why you're there and work your bottom off to get the best grade possible, either way, because once you get your degree, you'll have something you can say, "Hey, I didn't fail, I worked hard and passed, when I did, I did it!"

 I hope this helps.
 I'm pretty much not autistic (I haven't been diagnosed with dyspraxia, but I think I've been misdiagnosed by a doctor) but I walk on my toes nearly all the time.
 It's more comfortable for me.
 What makes them decide that a toe walk is a sign of autism when it seems so random and does not always indicate autism?
 Well, I might have a sign of something on the autism spectrum, but who has one or two?
 You guys know what I mean.
 walking on toes can be a sign of autism.
 A headache can be a sign of a brain tumor.
 Feeling a lot of tiredness may be a sign of leukaemia.
 The symptoms don't always apply, but it's worth noting that in a lot of cases, if there are a lot of symptoms (which is clearly the case in this instance), nothing will ever be diagnosed without a note, so nothing will ever be diagnosed without a note.
 I walk on my toes, but that's because I was born with a strange under-curved toe that had to be straightened out by surgery two years ago.
 My brother is autistic but I haven't noticed it either, the spectrum is so broad and I probably have mild Asperger's, so I have communication problems and don't pick up on social reaction/body language.
 But then again, I don't have the proper diagnosis, and even if you do have some symptoms, that doesn't mean you have a certain condition, you might not.
 I've been told for years not to walk on my toes, so I don't walk on my toes much.
 I have dyspraxia.
 So you may be dyspraxic or you may have a short tendon.
 Dancing/gymnastics/ballet/dancing etc. has been drilled into it to the point where I find it more comfortable now.
 I don't read too much into random symptoms like that.
 Hello, I'm a 12 year old girl who will be 13 in 2 days, a self-harming addict.
 I started to slit each individual finger with a scissors at 7 years old and never stopped from that day on.
 It's made worse because I have a scar on my leg from slitting a staple in my ex's name because I didn't stop cutting if I was bleeding.
 I have several slit holes in my arms.
 They healed and I then cut myself with a staple I stole from a school robber and a razor.
 I took around 5 paracetamol and other drugs and when I couldn't find the cut I took it with lager and vodka.
 I was really tempted to cut my arms off or burn myself when I wrote this.
 I was an addict, I cut again when one healed.
 I think about it every day.
 I'm 12 and I'm already sick and tired of my life.
 This is from a source where my dad left when I was 7 and didn't want to know me anymore.
 He just cares about his new little girl, his wife and his new life, where I don't want to be.
 My best mate died when I was 10.
 I was in a relationship with a 16 year old boy and due to events and differences of age I was forbidden from speaking to him.
 My mum also suffers from Bipolar and I have depression.
 I don't want to stop.
 I don't care what is done to me, I wanted it done time and time again to torture me, I hate myself.
 But I love my best mate loads and he means the world to me and if I do anything he will do it for me.
 I didn't tell him but he found out.
 I don't want to hurt him, I don't want him to hurt himself.
 What do I do?
 Thanks for reading.
 Are you on any drugs or are you getting any therapy?
 You should talk to your school nurse or your GP and tell them what's going on.
 There may be people in the school who you trust and can tell a school teacher.
 People can help you if you tell them.
 If you keep it bottled up inside it will likely only make it worse.
 Trust me, it would be better to get these things as early as possible rather than let them get even worse.
 Please don't do this.
 I was 17 when I started self harm last year, mainly cut my arms, but I stopped it a few months ago.
 It's hard but you can do it.
 I feel so much happier now, but seeing the scar reminds me of how I felt at that time and how strong I was, and how painful it is for me to want to do such a thing to myself.
 Also strong. You can do it. I found salvation through writing poetry and keeping a journal.
 Self harm is addictive, but you can overcome it.
 Remember self harm does not define who you are.
 You can overcome it.
 So I think I've got a form of OCD, because every time I go out, especially going to uni in the past year I've always found myself checking my belongings to make sure I haven't lost anything or left anything behind.
 I often have to check twice a go, and then for some reason I can't resist checking again after 30 seconds.
 Why is this?
 Am I crazy or something?
 It happens most often, when it's carrying many things, but only a few, if that, and it's still checking in many, many times a day, is this to any extent OCD?
 What can I do about this?
 If I don't check I get very anxious and sort of go away after 15-30 minutes but often there's so much anxiety I can't wait that long.
 I feel doomed if I lose my wallet or my phone, or I feel doomed if I lose my job.
 I just wish I could go out without worrying every 2 minutes that I'm leaving something or losing something.
 I don't really know what to do and am afraid to go to a GP.
 They will probably never hear of some compulsion like this, and I just don't know what to do.
 Do any of you have a similar ritual?
 People think I'm crazy, but it's very strange how you get out of this.
 Can you advise me?
 I used to do this on my way to college - had a list of items I knew I had on me, and used to compulsive check on the bus.
 Now I have more severe anxiety now and I think this is a warning sign, so just try to wean yourself off the habit when it is relatively fresh and definitely visit your doctor (although I would also tell you not to keep these things to yourself) I know it's easier said than done.
 Don't worry about that, the doctor will see a much worse case.
 <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/16/opinions-on-opinions-on- OCD/">I did OCD in a psychology class today :P</a>
 Just avoid the compulsive acting, there are ways to get rid of it, don't check if you're losing something and just leave it.
 Although your anxiety level will increase for the duration, it will gradually decrease, hopefully so that your OCD will disappear overtime.
 That just sounds to me like you're over anxious, rather than having a really bad OCD.
 I was very obsessed with getting up 20 times a night to check that all the locks in my house were locked, particularly the keys.
 Sometimes I'm convinced they aren't locked, even though I know they are.
 I think it will become a real problem when the obsession starts really interrupting your daily routine.
 Don't worry, you're definitely not crazy, and I'm sure your GP will understand the issue.
 I went to therapy also for other reasons and they encouraged me to pick and stick with a number that was obviously less than 20 when I checked and cut down.
 I think teaching myself is a good idea and if I get checked 5 times or 20 times, I'm still OK.
 So far I'm doing a lot better and I think there is definitely hope that anyone who wants to improve can.
 I'm usually pretty calm about things and like to take things as they come and don't worry too much.
 But in the last month or two I've found myself becoming really anxious about things, and I'm not talking about mere nervousness out of the blue.
 I began to feel irrational panic at a variety of things that I hadn't worried about too much beforehand, and that hadn't even crossed my mind as something that would cause the alarm bells to ring in my head.
 I'm not sure if this is due to lifestyle changes (going from a carefree student to an unemployed graduate) or if it's a sign of other issues, but it's beginning to bug me as it affects my confidence and happiness.
 I've spoken to a few people about it, including my parents, but all people think the same, I'm going through a random phase and should have held off action until it was clear there was a serious problem.
 So wonder what is the best thing to do?
 Speak to a doctor and see if an anti anxiety pill can take the edge off of things.
 I see if I can speak to a counsellor?
 Or should I take the advice of the close people around me and just keep an eye on anxiety until it becomes a problem?
 Well, I shouldn't start trying to keep an eye on your anxiety, as that will make me tense and more likely to panic, and there is a death circle there.
 As soon as you start feeling a bit panicked by anything, I recommend you try to focus on something that will make you smile or feel more happy.
 Or if you can't do that, get one of your friends to make you laugh when you start feeling panic - it works for me and I've suffered random panic attacks ( lol).
 I'm just starting to get really worried about tiny things (not as severe as you, but the way things are sounding),
 I find talking to someone else just about what makes you anxious might help.
 I found myself mentioning what I was worried about to my mum and seeing her react to the situation the way I should have, which made me feel better about it and make me know that it's not a big deal and I don't need to be anxious about it, but perhaps it's a way of not moaning.
 But if it gets worse, go to the doctor.
 I have a friend who suffers from severe anxiety that prevents him from leaving the house and doing things because he is so worried about what could go wrong.
 The doctor gave her medication and it made her much better.

 The International Atomic Energy Agency reached an agreement with Iranian officials that stated that there were no remaining issues and no ambiguities regarding Iran's nuclear program and activities.
 U.S. and European officials suspect that Iran's civilian nuclear energy program has been masked by efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce atomic bombs.
 U.S. and European officials suspect that Iran's civilian nuclear energy program has been masked by efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce atomic bombs.
 U.S. and European officials may impose a fourth round of sanctions on Tehran when the U.N. Security Council considers the issue of Iran's nuclear energy program most likely in September 2007.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) distributed a limited copy of the IAEA report before a meeting of its 35 board members on 11 September 2007.
 The find reflected an agreement between the agency and Tehran on August 21, 2007 that was publicized by Iranian officials beginning the week of 12 August 2007.
 The accord said there remained no issues and no ambiguity regarding Iran's nuclear program and activities.
 According to a Reuters news agency account the IAEA report said the steps forward in the work plan are a significant step forward.
 A senior U.N. official was quoted by Reuters as stating that the Iranian government's efforts to enrich uranium are slowing down.
 The IAEA report stated that Iranian officials must continue to build confidence in the scope and nature of Iran's present and future nuclear program.
 On 30 August 2007 Iranian officials stated that Iran would cooperate with the IAEA so as to be able to prevent a further round of international sanctions.
 Iran's representative to the IAEA Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated to the Fars News Agency in Tehran that the report emphasizes that there are no signs or evidence indicating that Iran's nuclear activities have been diverted and that all of Iran's nuclear materials are being audited.
 Some non-proliferation experts stated that the IAEA has ceded too much to Iran.
 In a criticism published the week of 19 August 2007 Washington-based arms control experts David Albright and Jacqueline Shire wrote that the idea of closing files violated fundamental safeguards principles and that the agreement did not specify that Iranian officials provide the IAEA with access to key people, facilities and documents needed to verify Iran's answer to the IAEA's questions.
 Independent experts stated that Iran's latest agreement with the IAEA to allow inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information falls short of Western demands that Iran halt the production of concentrated uranium which could be used in a potential bomb.
 Bush administration U.S. State Department spokesman Tom Casey stated that Iranian officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program but that the report could offer some new details or insight into the Iranian program's development.
 Casey stated that the nuclear program that is moving forward continues to show the Iranian regime's continued defiance of the international community.
 Most Western non-proliferation experts stated that the August 21, 2007 agreement contains little that could dissuade policy makers in Washington, London, Paris and Berlin from moving forward with another round of Security Council sanctions.
 Experts stated that many of the transparency issues reported in the August 21, 2007 agreement had been previously resolved and should be resolved.
 Executive Director of the non-partisan Arms Control Association in Washington Daryl G. Kimball stated that the agreement addresses problems in the Iranian government's pursuit of enriched technology and capabilities that could lead to the production of nuclear bomb material.
 Kimball stated that the Iranian government's design is to deflect criticism and pressure and claim progress has been made.
 Iranian officials stated that in the event of more sanctions Iran will be able to reduce by collaborating with the inspectors.
 The Security Council voted unanimously to impose sanctions on Iran despite the U.S. demand that the penalties be limited due to pressure from China and Russia.
 Soltanieh stated in an interview on state-controlled Iranian television that the report and measures make any other international organization including the Security Council irrelevant and unjustified intervention.

 A document was distributed to the Nuclear Suppliers Group outlining Israel's proposal that the Nuclear Suppliers Group allow international transfer of nuclear technology to States that have not signed on to non-proliferation rules.
 The proposal could complicate the Bush administration's efforts to win an exemption from an Indian ban on nuclear trade in order to engage in nuclear trade.
 Israeli officials convinced key groups of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines allowing the transfer of nuclear technology to States that have not signed on to non-proliferation rules.
 Countries that have not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) are prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade including the purchase of reactors, uranium fuel or yellowcake.
 In March 2007 a document outlining Israel's proposal was distributed to the 45 members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.
 The Israeli presentation was made without papers allowing for the possibility of official denial.
 A letter from the chairman of the NSG said the offer of the Israeli presentation was made in the context of a March 17, 2007 NSG debate on a bid by Indian officials for an exemption.
 India and Israel are the only two nations that have not signed the treaty and Israel's proposal is eligible for admission to the NSG.
 Israel's plan offers 12 criteria for allowing trade with non- Treaty-bound nuclear States.
 One criterion indicates Israel 's status as an undeclared nuclear weapons state , and says States should be allowed to engage in nuclear trade if they apply stringent physical protection , control and accounting measures against all nuclear weapons weapons and nuclear facilities , sources and special nuclear materials on their territory .
 The documents were circulated on Capitol Hill in September 2007 as the Bush administration worked toward an agreement with Indian officials.
 Executive Director of the Arms Control Association in Washington Daryl Kimball stated that the Israeli documents could affect the debate on India.
 Kimball stated --
 The dynamic at the NSG is that officials from the countries do not want to be an obstacle to the largest and most powerful country India and the United States.
 A consensus on India will be difficult to reach at an NSG meeting in November 2007.
 Israel 's proposal gives officials in some countries reason to suggest an alternative approach to specific exemptions .
 Israel's record of following international nuclear rules is good and better than India's.
 Despite ties between the Israeli and U.S. governments, the Bush administration rejected the Israeli proposal.
 The proposal could complicate the Bush administration's efforts to win an exemption from an Indian ban on nuclear trade in order to engage in nuclear trade.
 President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice view the pact as an important part of the Bush administration's foreign policy legacy.
 The deal is controversial in India and must be given approval by Congress.
 Delays in winning approval of the Indian deal could have negative effects on the administration's foreign policy legacy with the most negative effects occurring in the election year.
 State Department spokesman Tom Casey stated that the U.S. government views the Indian deal as unique and does not see it as precedent for any other country including Israel.
 Israeli embassy spokesman David Siegel stated that it is grossly inaccurate to suggest that the Israeli government has demanded the exemption or has linked the effort to any other issue including the India debate.
 Seigel stated --
 The Israeli Government has never asked the NSG for an exemption to nuclear supply guidelines or made any specific requests to the NSG.
 Israel has been recognized for its full-fledged adherence to the NSG guidelines.
 The Israeli government urged the NSG to consider adopting a generic multiple-tier approach to nuclear technology transfer based on criteria.
 Some NSG officials have previously suggested an approach similar to the Israeli plan.
 The nuclear non-proliferation regime would be considerably enhanced if the NSG guidelines were modified in the line proposed by Israeli officials.

 Iran (IR)
 International; proliferation
 Ahmadinejad announced the expansion of Iran's uranium production capability.
 Iran has refused to commit to halt the expansion but has hinted that there may be a future halt.
 On 26 July 2008 Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stated to scholars in the northeastern city of Mashbad that Iran will expand its arsenal of enriched uranium-producing centrifuges to over 5000.
 Ahmadinejad's statement was the first assertion of expansion since it was announced in April 2008 that Iran was approaching implementation of 6000 centrifuges.
 Iran has articulate a goal of 50,000 centrifuges operating at an enrichment plant near the town of Natanz.
 The international community demands that Iran halt the production of nuclear material.
 Media reports differ on the number of centrifuges Ahmadinejad cited.
 The Iranian news agency reported that Ahmadinejad stated that Iran had 6000 working centrifuges but subsequently removed the statement from the Internet.
 Another Iranian news agency stated that Ahmadinejad referred to hundreds of thousands of centrifuges.
 Experts discount the significance of Ahmadinejad's claims due to the absence of information on the centrifuge's function.
 A Western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity in Tehran stated that the number of centrifuges is less important than whether the machines are operating and whether they are efficient but Ahmadinejad's assertions will hinder the resolution of the diplomatic standoff between Iran and the West.
 Arms control expert at the New America Foundation Jeffrey G. Lewis stated that the New America Foundation is aware of Iran's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but does not know the operational status of the machines.
 Diplomats and arms control experts stated that technical problems are hindering Iran's enrichment program.
 Iran has repeatedly asserted that the aim of its nuclear program is only to produce electricity and that the production of nuclear weapons is contrary to Islamic principles.
 The US, Israel, Europe and a majority of Western arms control experts believe Iran is pursuing the ability to produce a bomb immediately upon decision.
 Experts stated that the production of weapons-grade uranium from reactor-grade material is relatively simple.
 Ahmadinejad stated that after Iran's resistance to Western demands to halt Iran's nuclear activities the West is still pursuing a resumption of negotiations.
 EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana recently presented two offers to Iran.
 The US- endorsed package of incentives is an incentive to cease production of enriched uranium.
 The pre-negotiated freeze is a 6-week period during which Iran will not add centrifuges and the West will refrain from promoting a fourth round of economic sanctions against Iran at the UN Security Council.
 US officials have repeatedly stated that no negotiations can begin before Iran has halted all enrichment-related activities that are verifiable but the Bush administration recently agreed to a proposed freeze and dispatched Burns to Geneva.
 On 26 July 2008 Iran refused to respond to Solana's offer at talks in Geneva attended by US Undersecretary of State William J. Burns.
 The talks constituted the highest-level diplomatic contact between the US and Iran in nearly 30 years.
 Solana, Burns and the European envoy set a deadline for a positive response from Iran before Solana and the European envoys will initiate new sanctions including a prohibition on sales of refined petroleum products vital to Iran's economy.
 Iranian officials refused to commit themselves to stop the expansion or observe the deadline.
 On 26 July 2008 Ahmadinejad appeared to suggest that Iran could potentially halt the expansion over a period of over 6 weeks at a higher number of centrifuges than previously expected.
 Ahmadinejad stated that the existing 5000-6000 operational centrifuges would be of no use to the West if the number of centrifuges would not increase.
 5,000 centrifuges could produce enough material for a nuclear power plant or atomic bomb if highly enriched.
 6000 centrifuges continuously running could produce weapons-grade uranium sufficient for 1 bomb in 6 months.
 In May 2008 the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated that Iran possessed 3500 operational centrifuges.

 The Paris diplomatic meeting concluded with no agreement on further steps to pressure Iran to halt uranium enrichment at the Iranian facility at Natanz.
 Diplomats stated to the media on 14 November 2008 that officials from the United States, Europe, Russia and China did not reach agreement at a meeting in Paris on 13 November 2008 to take further action to persuade Iran to halt uranium enrichment at the Iranian facility in Natanz.
 Uranium enrichment is a highly technical process that can produce fuel for nuclear power plants and can produce fissile material for atomic weapons.
 The meeting on 13 November 2008 ended with no new measures announced.
 After the 13 November 2008 meeting the French Foreign Ministry released a statement declaring that after the 13 November 2008 meeting the international community reaffirmed the importance of a dual track approach to the diplomatic engagement with Iran and towards sanctions work on a dual track approach.
 Russia and China will resist new sanctions against Iran.
 Russia and China have close political and business ties with the Islamic Republic of Iran and do not feel any domestic pressure to act against Iran.
 The United States has no close political and business ties with the Islamic Republic of Iran and feels domestic pressure to act against the country.
 Russia and China hold the veto power at the Security Council.
 Russian diplomat Sergei Ryabkov was quoted by the Interfax news agency in Moscow as saying that at the meeting on 13 November 2008 the parties would not strike a deal on sanctions against Iran and that while Western countries are in favor of sanctions against Iran China and Russia are not.
 Sergei Ryabkov attended the meeting on 13 November 2008.
 According to reports released this week Iran has made significant progress on a heavy water research reactor facility near Arak.
 An Iranian heavy water research reactor near Arak could eventually produce plutonium which could be used in a nuclear weapon.
 Satellite images published by the Institute for Science and International Security showed significant progress in construction of a heavy water research reactor facility near Arak between February 2008 and October 2008.
 David Albright stated that the Iranian heavy water research reactor near Arak has evaded the notice of the international security community.
 David Albright stated that satellite images have said that the Iranian heavy water research reactor near Arak has made significant progress and has progressed from a building frame to a largely finished facility in the past year and a half.
 David Albright is a former arms inspector and director of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security.
 Iran has stated that Iran is pursuing nuclear technology to produce energy and to conduct research.
 The United States and its Western allies suspect Iran's efforts to produce a nuclear weapon are a precursor to the creation of a nuclear weapons infrastructure.
 The production of low-grade uranium is legal under international arms control regulations.
 Iran's latest nuclear technology development shows a complex technical and diplomatic challenge facing the incoming foreign policy team of US President-elect Barack Obama's incoming foreign policy team in taking on the task of stopping Iran from mastering technology that could be used to manufacture and deliver nuclear weapons.
 Last month when it was in power , the administration of US President George W. Bush managed to synchronize its policies with those of the leaders of the European Union , Britain , France and Germany to press for tougher sanctions against Iran and diplomatic action .
 The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is expected to release a critical report on Iran next week.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency is the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency.
 A new initiative on the Iranian nuclear program has not emerged from the November 13, 2008 Paris talks and hopes of imposing another set of United Nations Security Council sanctions before the end of President Bush's term have decreased.
 During the diplomatic maneuvering Iran continues to work toward masterminding nuclear and missile technology.
 Some Israeli officials stated that they were alarmed by Iran's test this week of a 2-stage solid fuel rocket with a range of 1200 miles (2500 kilometers).
 Tel Aviv is less than 650 miles from Iranian territory.

 A high-security Russian laboratory complex storing anthrax, plague and other deadly bacteria faces loss of electricity due to lack of payment to electricity utility Mosenergo.
 A large repository of deadly anthrax, plague and other killer bacteria stored in a high-security Russian laboratory complex 100 miles south of Moscow threatens to lose electricity.
 Officials from the Mosenergo electricity utility in the Moscow region have recently arrived at a Russian laboratory complex and threatened to turn off the electricity due to lack of payment.
 The Russian laboratory complex is a 90-building campus and served as a secret site for secret biological weapons programs during the Soviet era.
 An incorrect headline in the Izvestia newspaper stated that a deadly virus from a Moscow regional depository has threatened Moscow.
 No virus was found at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology in Obolensk.
 Every kind of killer bacterium that had been studied for use in the Soviet Union's secret biological weapons program was at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology.
 A large virus repository is located in Siberia.
 Russian and Western officials stated that power cuts at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology are unlikely to result in any threat to public health.
 Russian and Western officials stated that there is not enough certainty to know if the loss of power at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is a public health threat.
 General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology has quite a reliable and emergency protection system in place.
 General Nikolai N. Urakov has been the director of the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology for a longtime.
 The State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is working with Western scientists to convert the complex into a biomedicine manufacturing site .
 General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that the people at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology were scared by this threat of a sudden electricity shut-down because it was of a kind of psychological pressure.
 General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that if power at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is shut down the scientists will have to destroy all bacteriological experiments under way.
 General Nikolai N. Urakov would like the United States and Western countries , which have contributed about 6 million US dollars to the transformation of the former bioweapon complex , to contribute another 500,000 US dollars per year to pay the electric bills and arrears of the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology .
 An American scientist who works closely with the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology stated that it is the Russian government's responsibility to pay the State Scientific Center's electric bill.
 Western aid to convert the bioweapon laboratory of General Nikolai N. Urakov at one time peaked in 1997 when it was learned that Iran was offering to purchase experts from the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology.
 It is known that the sense of crisis has been orchestrated by Russian scientists and military leaders who are now depending on Western financing to destroy nuclear, chemical and biological weapons in order to increase finance.
 American scientist Randall Lee Beatty worked to convert the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology in Obolensk.
 Beatty stated that this threat of electricity cuts at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is a crisis.
 Randall Lee Beatty is Director of the International Science and Technology Center at the International Science and Technology Center.
 General Nikolai N. Urakov's International Science and Technology Center will finance approximately half of General Urakov's budget to support about 350 Russian scientists and technicians in biowarfare.
 Randall Lee Beatty stated that it is known that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology has not paid its electricity bill for 14 months.
 Randall Lee Beatty stated that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is one of the most important archives of dangerous pathogen information in the world and that the destruction of the institute due to non-payment of electricity utility bills is a shame.
 Approximately 3000 strains of bacterium are stored at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology and many of them are stored in cryogenics cooled in liquid nitrogen cooling casks isolated from the environment with layer enclosures and oversize air handling systems all dependent on electricity for their function.
 Defrosting live germs that are currently in a frozen state of preservation is the greatest danger from the shut-down of electric power at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology.
 Biological warfare expert at the Monterey Institute of International Studies Raymond Zilinskas stated that the main threat to the organism was the cut in power to the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology rather than the possibility of escape.
 Raymond Zilinskas stated that in the worst case the bacterium is defused from -70 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and the clean-up afterward is a real mess because it is certain not all the bacterium will die.
 Another example is the confrontation between the electricity utility Mosenergo and the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology in Obolensk , where the basic capitalist imperative to sustain enterprises could potentially clash dangerously with the old remains of Soviet weapons science .
 Due to an overdue power bill in 2000 the Russian National Power Company cut off electricity to strategic bases where nuclear missiles stand on high alert.
 Nuclear missile silos do not lose power.
 Armed troops marched into the substation and turned the power back on.
 National company United energy systems cuts power in January and February 2001 to a number of military installations around Russia.
 Military installations that lost power included a Kamchatka space forces monitoring center.
 In most cases the military installations where electricity was cut off were quickly restored.
 The investigation has often shown that the utilities and military have a war-time tug of war that forces them to spend funds on electricity power instead of other uses of money.
 Some of the budget funds that have been cut at times have included building a country residence for the General.

 Brazil has implemented laws allowing the air force to target drug trafficking aircraft in Brazilian airspace.
 The US is concerned about liability if civilian planes are misidentified.
 Brazil announced that the Air Force will begin shooting down aircraft used to trafficking illegal drugs in Brazilian airspace.
 The plan requires eight steps of precaution before the order to shoot down the plane can be issued.
 The publicity campaign notified ranchers and others that they need to file a flight plan prior to the policy taking effect in late October 2004.
 The law permitting such action was originally approved in 1998 but was never put into effect by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso who was in office from 1995 to 2003.
 The United States dissuaded Cardoso from signing the decree out of concern that the accident downing of the civilian aircraft could expose the Government and the company to lawsuits from the United States.
 In April 2001 the United States reduced its support for previous drug-running operations when a Peruvian jet shot down a small plane misidentified as a drug carrier and killed a US missionary and his children.
 Victim's relatives sued the US government and won a settlement because the US government provided intelligence and technical support for the operation.
 A US State Department official stated --
 US law may forbid assistance to countries that implement shoot-down laws under certain conditions.
 The US agreed with Brazil's assessment that the threat posed by drug traffickers is very serious and increasing.
 The US government is consulting with the Brazilian government on Brazilian law provisions.
 Brazilian Defense Minister Jose Viegas stated that Brazil encountered difficulties in securing US support for the plan but recent bilateral talks have led to the certainty that the US government will accept the decree without exposing Brazil to commercial sanctions.
 Brazilian officials expressed hope that the US will endorse the policy before it goes into effect.
 The US is scheduled to provide Brazil with 10.2 million dollars in drug and law enforcement aid in 2004.
 Former Brazilian Air Force chief and current director of the Air Institute at Rio de Janeiro's Estacio de Sa University Mauro Jose Miranda Gandra stated that the government's step towards the measure is a courageous one but the impact could be more political than practical due to the restrictions imposed by the Brazilian government.
 Brazilian officials stated that the policy may not apply to aircraft on which children were on board.
 Viegas stated that there is a need for limits.
 Gandra stated that the provisions undermine the essential purpose of the decree by granting immunity to drug-smuggling aircraft carrying children and by introducing the possibility of using kidnapped children as human shields.
 Viegas stated in an interview in Brasilia that the Government will use more powerful laws to dissuade drug traffickers who had previously entered Brazilian airspace without feeling threatened by the Air Force.
 The deteriorating public security situation regarding increasingly powerful and violent drug gangs in Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro in particular prompted the government to take action.
 Rio de Janeiro's drug gangs have more firepower than the police and have successfully attacked police stations and forced businesses and schools to close.
 In a 2003 interview with a foreign correspondent President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva stated --
 The policy is a matter of national sovereignty and security.
 Some drug-running aircraft pilots feel so confident in their immunity from retribution that they make obscene hand gestures at pursuing Brazilian Air Force pilots.
 The law is constitutionally questionable under Brazilian law which prohibits the death penalty as a punishment for criminal acts.
 Some legal experts and other commentators stated that the statute amounts to a de facto execution of a drug trafficker contrary to the government's claims.
 The daily O Estado de Sao Paolo stated in an editorial the week of 18 July 2004 to 24 July 2004 that the extreme measures raise ethical and juridical problems that exceed any potential benefits.
 The penalties are applied extrajudicial under administrative decisions made by the Air Force commander.
 These people gained a living and death power over crew members and non-stop passengers.
 In 2002 Brazil inaugurated a 1.4 billion dollar SIVAM radar system that will allow the government to monitor air activity throughout the expansive Amazon basin for the first time.
 The system uses American technology.
 Illegal flights initially declined by 30 percent due to concern about the improved tracking capability of traffickers but have subsequently reaccelerated.
 Brazil has recorded 4,128 unauthorised flights in 2003.
 Some of these flights were innocent violations by ranch hands flying between plantations in the Amazon.
 Viegas stated that there has been a significant increase in deliberate violations of Brazilian airspace by drug smugglers who appear to be aware of the government's inability to retaliate.
 Rio de Janeiro's most notorious drug dealer Fernandinho Beira-Mar was captured in Colombia in April 2001 in a gun-for-drug pipeline involving left-wing guerrillas.
 Brazil's northern Amazon corridor has become an increasingly busy and essential route for global drug trade and has been used to smuggle arms, gold and diamonds.
 One of the most important routes to supply cocaine to Europe and smuggle drugs and guns reportedly runs across Colombia and Suriname across the northern tier of the Amazon.
 Colombia is the only country that currently has a policy that targets drug-trafficking aircraft.
 Colombia is a source of much of the cocaine and heroin sold in the United States.

 The Venezuelan president's weapons deals with Russia, his curbs on military cooperation with the United States and plans to train as many as two million Venezuelan civilians to repel a possible superpower invasion have worried both the United States and his domestic critics.
 Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's weapons deals with Russia, his curbs on military cooperation with the United States, and his plans to train as many as two million civilians to repel a possible invasion by an imperialist superpower have worried the United States and domestic critics of Chavez as well as former military officers on the left.
 Chavez insisted that the move was purely defensive and was born of the need to update obsolete military hardware and to protect Venezuela from nations that might want to control it.
 Venezuela is South America's largest petroleum producer.
 Chavez 's domestic opponents scoffed at the idea of a US invasion of Venezuela ever happening , charging that he truly intended to arm a huge cadre of loyal reservists to protect him against any internal uprising and pose a militarized counterweight to US influence in Latin America .
 Chavez was a major ally of Cuban leader Fidel Castro and grew closer to him.
 According to Chavez 's detractors in the US government , even more troubling is that the purchase of arms and indoctrination of civilian militias could be even more problematic as part of a strategy to restructure Venezuelan democracy with a Cuban - style militarized socialist image , a strategy that would foment a leftist revolution throughout South America .
 US military strategists say they are increasingly concerned that such a revolution could be fomented by radical moves inspired by Chavez.
 The political mainstream in Latin America has shifted leftward since the late 1990s.
 This shift to the left is largely a reaction to the perceived failure of free market economics.
 The leftists were elected to lead Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Ecuador and Venezuela.
 Chavez supporters at home countered that the United States has a century-long history of openly and covert armed and covert intervention in Latin America's domestic politics and said the United States has no right to question Venezuela's preparedness for defense.
 Carlos Roque Espinoza Leon said the Venezuelans never asked what the US marines were doing.
 Espinoza Leon is a pro-Chavez defense specialist and served in Venezuela's National Assembly.
 Espinoza said Peru has 500,000 rifles and no one has said anything.
 Espinoza said no one is complaining that Colombia is the most militarized country in Latin America.
 Espinoza said the US history is full of aggression in Latin America.
 Espinoza said the Venezuelans must do whatever is necessary to protect themselves.
 Chavez famously said that the so-called Venezuelan Bolivarian Revolution was peaceful but armed.
 Chavez was first elected in 1998 and the independent Datanalisis polling firm rated his popularity at 71 percent.
 Venezuelan military analyst Alberto Garrido said that in Russia, China and Iran, Chavez is looking to his allies to promote a multi-polar world to counter US dominance, encouraging grass-roots moves in Latin America to throw off US government influence.
 Lorenzo Campos is a farmer in the northern Venezuelan state of Anzoategui and a reservist.
 Campos said the Venezuelans want the world to know that they are not preparing to attack anyone and that they are being protected for the mission.
 In May 2005 Chavez's government announced details of a deal with a Russian firm to purchase 100000 AK-103 assault rifles with 30 rounds of ammunition each at a cost of 18.6 million dollars and a technology transfer to Venezuela to manufacture the rifles.
 The deal worked out at $ 186.22 per rifle per rifle.
 This price is considerably less than the 825 to 850 dollars price of the same weapons ordered by US mail.
 The Venezuelan government also intends to buy 10 helicopters from Russia, 10 transport planes from Spain and 6 naval craft from Spain.
 Venezuelan officials said the government is negotiating with Brazil to buy around 24 air support and training planes.
 Chavez insisted, and even his most staunch military critics here -- even his most staunch military critics -- agree that the purchase is essential to update old weaponry such as the decades-old FAL rifles from Belgium.
 Retired General Fernando Ochoa Antich said it is exaggerated to say that Chavez is engaged in an arms build-up.
 Ochoa was defense minister in 1992 when then Lieutenant Colonel Chavez launched a failed coup.
 Ochoa stated that Venezuela has not purchased arms in the past 25 years and said that Chavez has not bought weapons aggressively or under threat to his neighbors.
 Ochoa said that Venezuela has never bought arms from Russia before and suggested that Chavez bought them to become independent of the US.
 Ochoa asked why Chavez bought a rifle caliber popular with subvertive forces in Latin America and stated that Chavez's political support of radical leftist moves makes him a continent-wide menace.
 The US Pentagon openly questioned what Chavez was doing with the old FAL rifles and whether he could have shared weapons or ammunition with Latin American guerrilla forces.
 The US government has provided no evidence that Chavez has armed or funded a leftist insurgency.
 Military analysts and military specialists analyzing Colombian FARC guerrillas say the rebels have plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking and have no interest in old Belgian rifles or Chavez's assistance.
 A 2003 study published by the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) reported that more than half of the weapons seized by Colombian guerrillas from 1998-2001 and marked foreign military marked weapons originated from Venezuela.
 The implication is that corrupt or sympathetic members of the Venezuelan military may have aided guerrillas.
 The ideological and ideological training , according to critics , that Chavez has in mind for the military and new civilian reservists could be more distressful for domestic Chavez opponents .
 Earlier in 2005, Chavez so called for the so-called revolutionary units to start preparing the public to resist superpower aggressors, saying that the first step in doing so would be training 100,000 to 200,000 volunteers to back up active duty armed forces in the coming years.
 Military analysts estimate the number of Venezuela's active-duty armed forces at 83,000.
 People 's defense units were created in neighborhoods , state companies , and the Free University established under Chavez , and they report directly to the President .
 The government insists the reserves will support the armed forces and will not act as a fifth column against a possible anti-Chavez coup .
 Espinoza said the reserves should not be used for troops that would shock any political party and that in a civil war each person decides his own side.
 General Julio Ramon Quintero Viloria is the reserve commander.
 Quintero said in an interview that the armed forces hope to train 50,000 civilians over the second half of 2005 over 20 weekends and 300,000 more in 2006.
 Quintero said the Venezuelans do not want to be a colony of any empire and must be ready for any empire.
 200,000 reservists and the Venezuelan navy engaged in massive war games in June 2005 to repel a stronger invading country.
 40 employees of state oil companies participated in similar exercises with 1200 soldiers in June 2005.
 The pro-Chavez circles here have warned of asymmetric warfare.
 " asymmetric warfare" is a term coined by US military strategists that describes conflicts in which there are no equal combatants and where the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics.
 The US government has given Colombia 3.3 billion dollars in military aid over the past five years , the most recent from the US government .
 Chavez loyalists fear that a proxy war between Colombia and Venezuela could be instigated by the US government as a way to oust Chavez and control oil from Venezuela.
 In an interview , a senior US official dismissed the notion that the United States government wants to invade Venezuela as completely and utterly nonsense .
 The official said that the Chavez side wishes to make a negative relationship with the US because of political calculations that Mr. Chavez will reach power by constantly confronting the US.
 Another development troubling the United States is that Chavez is rolling back military cooperation and joint exercises.
 The US military has had a Cooperation Office in a Venezuelan fort for 50 years.
 Chavez shut it down in 2004.
 5 US military trainers and students participating in the exchange program were ordered to leave the country in April 2005.
 Analysts said Chavez is likely to try to indoctrinate his public and his armed forces.
 Analysts have said that there is no proof that Chavez has used those forces to aid leftist revolutions elsewhere.

 The North Korean government may be prepared to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor in June 2007 as the first step towards disabling the reactor by December 2007.
 On 18 June 2007 Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill stated that the North Korean government may be prepared to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor in June 2007 as the first step towards disabling the reactor by December 2007.
 Hill is the United States head of negotiations on North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
 Hill stated that stalled efforts to dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons program could move ahead after the weekend of 16-17 June 2007 when International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors are to visit Pyongyang at the invitation of Pyongyang for talks on verifying and monitoring the shut down.
 Hill stated following talks with Chinese negotiator Wu Dawei that the shutdown was long anticipated.
 Hill stated that it is possible that the website will shut down in the weeks to come but it is not possible in the months to come.
 The Associated Press reported from Vienna, Austria that the IAEA stated in a statement on 18 June 2007 that a team would visit Pyongyang the week of 24 June 2007 to discuss the manner in which inspectors would verify the shut-down.
 Hill stated that IAEA inspectors will hold talks with Pyongyang officials on sealing the reactor including installing television monitors at the site.
 North Korean officials refused to proceed with the agreement to begin decommissioning the Yongbyon reactor in February 2007 until 25 million dollars worth of funds in a North Korean-linked account held in a Macao bank had been transferred to North Korea.
 The money was frozen as United States officials accused Banco Delta Asia of complicity in financial crimes on behalf of North Korea.
 The funds were wired to the New York Federal Reserve Bank on June 14, 2007 after months of disagreement over the method of returning the funds.
 The funds are supposed to be sent to Russia's Central Bank before being transferred to accounts controlled by the North Korean government at Russian commercial banks.
 Hill stated that there will be talks the week of 17 June 2007 between disarmament negotiators from Russia, South Korea and Japan to talk about steps to recoup some of the time lost in organizing the financial transfer.
 The discussions will also involve setting a timetable for the resumption of arms control talks between the 6 nations.
 Under an agreement reached in February 2007 North Korean officials pledged to shut down the Yongbyon reactor and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the reactor's shutdown in return for a shipment of 50,000 tons of fuel oil.
 In the next phase of the agreement North Korean officials will declare an end to all nuclear programs and disabled all facilities in return for a further 950000 tons of fuel oil.
 Hill stated that technically the next phase of the agreement could be concluded by December 2007.

 A leading arms control expert has criticized the new nuclear activities plan released by Iran and the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as ineffective and dangerous.
 On August 27, 2007 Iran and the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released plans to resolve the issue by December 2007.
 The issue has been unresolved for 4 years.
 The plan is meant to allay suspicions about Iran's past nuclear activities.
 An agency official stated that the plan is a breakthrough.
 On 28 August 2007 Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stated at a news conference in Tehran --
 The investigation into Iran's nuclear activities is now closed.
 None of the other members of the International Atomic Energy Agency have co-operated as well as Iran has.
 Iran is a nuclear nation.
 Iran has a nuclear fuel cycle.
 Iran will not succumb to international pressure to curb its nuclear project.
 Iran's nuclear project is for peaceful purposes.
 The United States and some European nations believe the purpose of Iran's nuclear project is to make nuclear weapons.
 Several Western governments and leading arms control experts have stated that Iran is attempting to avoid further U.N. Security Council punishment.
 Western Governments include the United States and France.
 Government and experts believe Iran is making an attempt.
 The arms control process is slow.
 The question of Iran's past violations of the treaty was avoided as an answer.
 physicist and president of the Institute for Science and International Security David Albright stated --
 Iran's claims have been unverifiable.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency has no access to people, documents and sites.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency would lose the right to any further questions in the future.
 The unusual development set a bad precedent.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency may be tricks because the Agency is eager for a deal.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency plan was announced.
 Iran has resolved the question of its past plutonium experiments without explaining how.
 Senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies Mark Fitzpatrick stated --
 The International Atomic Energy Agency plan is superficial.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) plan has drawn out negotiations for many months.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency's plans could leave Iran with an incomplete and misleading answer to the IAEA.
 The International Institute for Strategic Studies is located in London.
 Plutonium is the material that can be used to make nuclear weapons.
 The Institute for Science and International Security is a private research organization located in Washington.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency is based in Vienna.

 A list from the Nuclear Suppliers Group shows that Iran has been denied approximately 75 times for purchase of nuclear-related materials from the Nuclear Suppliers Group since 1998 on suspicion that the materials could be used to build bombs.
 A list from the Nuclear Suppliers Group shows that Iran has been denied approximately 75 times for purchase of nuclear-related materials from the Nuclear Suppliers Group since 1998 on suspicion that the materials could be used to build bombs.
 The 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group is an offshoot of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and is charged with monitoring international trade to ensure that nuclear technology transferred for peaceful purposes is not directed towards military use.
 The Nuclear Suppliers Group is composed of technologically advanced countries.
 The mission statement of the Nuclear Suppliers Group said countries will act on an individual basis to block trade that violates export controls devised to maintain international cooperation in peaceful use of nuclear energy.
 The Nuclear Suppliers Group has no enforcement power beyond to notify companies when they violate the group's guidelines.
 The Nuclear Suppliers Group keeps the data private and meets in large secret.
 Most of the purchases have been denied since 2002 and are the result of intervention by members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.
 Diplomats from countries interested in exposing the extent of Iran's efforts to acquire so-called dual use items that could be converted to weapons production have availed themselves of the trade ban list.
 The list is availble to the list but without identifying the diplomats and the countries from which they are from.
 The list named companies from Australia, Finland, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, and Iran among companies prevented from carrying out the deal on suspicion that the sale items were of military usefulness.
 Among the items offered for sale as part of the blocked deal , the items on the list include nickel powder , petrochemical plant components , compressors , furnaces , steel flanges and fitting , electron microscopes , radiometric ore sorting machines , valves and tubing , lasers , rotary drilling rigs , mass spectrometers , and nitrogen production plants .
 Iranian end-use organizations include the Iranian government and its Atomic Energy Organization, power and engineering companies, petrochemical and oil-refining companies, gas companies, the aircraft industry, schools, universities, engine manufacturers, mineral research centers, helicopter support companies and plasma physics centers.
 Diplomats stated that the 75 denials represented only the actions of 7 of the 45 member states.
 Diplomats stated that the actual number of denied sales of dual use products to Iran is probably much higher than 75.
 Western diplomats stated that as the standoff with Iran continues over Iran's nuclear program the government in Tehran is using front companies to receive and convert technology for weapons production without detection.
 Iran has signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty but is not a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.

 Iraq's official website of Shiite leader Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani was among the defaced and blocked websites.
 On the defaced website the group XP stated that any website containing material contrary to Sunni teachings had been hacked.
 Iraq's official website of Shiite leader Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani has been defaced and blocked in a cyber attack on a Shiite-related site in a sectarian-motivated cyber attack.
 It was not clear if the attacks began on September 18, 2008 or the morning of September 19, 2008.
 Al-Sistani's website was down on the evening of 19 September 2008.
 Another website related to one of Al-Sistani's religious organizations, www.al-shia.com, was also affected.
 The alternative address www.sistani.com is still operational.
 The Iranian Fars news agency stated that the XP group blocked access to approximately 300 Shiite-related sites on September 18 and 19, 2008.
 The hacking claim and Iran's assertion that the XP group is based in the United Arab Emirates cannot be independently verified.
 Several Iranian news sites stated on September 19, 2008 that many of the Shiite and Iranian-related web sites that had been attacked were running normally again.
 The statement signed by the XP group was posted on the home page of Al-Sistani's web site and stated that the attack was carried out on behalf of the Sunni Muslim group.
 According to the statement --
 The XP group has carried out similar attacks on other Shiite sites in the Persian Gulf and Iraq.
 The XP group erased the sites as they have done with other Rafidha sites.
 Rafidha means reject and is an insult used by Sunni extremists to describe Shiites.
 Al-Sistani promoted sexual deviance and the Iranian agenda in Iraq as he was born in Iran.
 Any website with material contrary to Sunni Islamic teaching will be punished.
 The statement also consists of a video clip from the American comedian Bill Maher's YouTube clip that ridicules Al-Sistani's fatwa on whether married couples may be permitted certain sexual intercourse positions.
 The office of the ayatollah in Najaf declined to comment on the cyber attack.
 Fars reported that counter-attacks were carried out against 2 major Wahhabi web sites belonging to the puritanical Sunni Islamic strain that is dominant in Saudi Arabia.

 Somali pirates who hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large arms cargo approach a deal to release the ship.
 Questions have emerged regarding arms shipments via the route to Kenya and possible clandestine deals between Kenya and South Sudan.
 Maritime officials and associates of Somali pirates who hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large arms cargo on 25 September 2008 that carried a cargo of arms stated on 8 October 2008 that the pirates may soon collect their ransom.
 After difficult negotiations likened to bazaar-style haggling among several people involved, the parties came close to reaching a deal to pay millions of dollars to the pirates and free the ship.
 businessman Ahmed Omar in Xarardheere, Somalia stated that the pirates agreed to a ransom of approximately 8 million U.S. dollars (4 million euro) from the ship's owners and that the ship could be freed by October 8 or 9, 2008.
 Xarardheere is a notorious pirate base on Somalia's coast.
 A maritime official in Kenya stated that critical details have yet to be agreed upon.
 One such detail involves a pirate's request for a guarantee that the armada of American warships currently encircling the pirates will not arrest or attack them.
 An anonymous Kenyan maritime official stated that such negotiations are complex and involve more than financial aspects.
 An official stated on October 8, 2008 that there has been progress and that the parties have approached an agreement.
 The pirates initially requested 35 million U.S. dollars (22 million euro) and then reduced the request to 20 million dollars.
 The pirates have consistently expressed willingness to negotiate financial figures.
 More than 25 ships were hijacked off the Somali coast in 2008 with the typical ransom being between 1 and 2 million U.S. dollars (1 to 2 million euro).
 The pirate on board the Ukrainian ship stated that the ship, its cargo and the 20 sailors on board will be released once the ship and its 20 sailors are received payment of 100 United States dollars and the pirate would prefer a 100 dollar bill.
 The question is the original destination of the arms shipment that was on board the Ukrainian ship.
 The Kenyan government claimed that the weapons on board were shipped shortly after the freighter was hijacked on 25 September 2008 to the Kenyan military.
 The ship was on the route to Kenya's main port of Mombasa.
 The weapons on board the ship included 33 T-72 tanks, 150 grenade launchers, 6 anti-aircraft guns and large quantities of ammunition.
 Evidence subsequently emerged that the weapons were part of a clandestine arms deal between Kenya and a separatist region in southern Sudan.
 If the pirates did not hijack the ship and begin speaking to the media through satellite phones the deal would most likely remain secret.
 Ukrainian officials have been adamant in denying any wrongdoing.
 Ukrainian diplomat in Kenya Oleh Belokolos stated --
 Ukraine has not supplied any armsaments to the Government of South Sudan or has any plans to do so.
 All appropriate paperwork has been done.
 Ukraine has abiding by all United Nations rules and arms control agreements.
 After the collapse of the Soviet Union Ukraine inherited enormous weaponry stockpiles and has now entered into major arms deals.
 The deal with Ukraine is considered suspicious because Kenya relies most on the United Kingdom and other Western countries for its heavy weapons supplies.
 Kenyan politicians demanded answers and called for several commissions to be set up to examine the situation.
 South Sudan is an autonomous region that is currently increasing its military using Soviet-designed tanks.
 The United States military stated that it is a priority to ensure that the ship does not unload weapons and that the weapons are not sold to Islamic insurgents in Somalia.
 The pirates denied any interest in weapons and claimed they were not aware that the tanks were included in the cargo when they hijacked the ship.
 Last week pirate spokesman Sugule Ali stated in an interview that the pirates were solely interested in the deal for money.

 Head of the U.N. Drug Office Antonio Maria Costa said Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban have cut back on poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in an effort to support the price and preserve a major source of funding for the insurgency.
 Head of the U.N. Drug Office Antonio Maria Costa said Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban have cut back on poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in an effort to support the price and preserve a major source of funding for the insurgency.
 Costa said this to reporters last week as the U.N. Drug Office prepares to release its latest survey of Afghanistan's opium crop.
 The survey showed that poppy cultivation is in retreat in much of Afghanistan and is overwhelmingly concentrated in 7 of the 34 provinces where the insurgency remains strong, mostly in the south.
 The survey was issued on November 27, 2008.
 The United Nations found that a reduction of 19 percent in the amount of land devoted to opium cultivation in Afghanistan resulted in a drop in total opium production by just 6 percent despite a drop in total opium production by 6 percent.
 The study stated that high output per acre was attributed to a good growing season in the south.
 The southern region is a heavily irrigated area where the Taliban maintain a strong presence in the 5 provinces and have systematically encouraged opium cultivation in order to finance their insurgency for several years.
 The U.N. estimates the insurgents made much of the opium trade worth 300 million dollars last year.
 Costa said a lot of the war effort could be funded by between two and three billion dollars.
 The Taliban produced an amount of opium far exceeding world demand due to three successive years of bumper crops.
 Costa said the result will be a glut which will depress prices which will drop approximately 20 percent.
 Costa said there is evidence that the Taliban, drug lords and even some farmers have stockpiled opium because the price has not already collapsed.
 The increased amount is also being processed in Afghanistan.
 Costa added that the insurgents hold a significant amount of opium.
 Costa said there was a surplus as much as 11,000 tons (more than twice the world's demand over the past three years) and threatened to devalue their stockpiles.
 The United Nations found Afghanistan produced 8500 tons of opium in 2008.
 The world demand is estimated at about 4.4 million tons per year.

 Hong Kong police are trying to prevent Triad or transnational criminal syndicates from engaging in criminal activities.
 Hong Kong police recently smashed transnational theft syndicates specializing in exploiting youngsters to commit various crimes, cross-border criminal syndicates and local triad gangs.
 In the opinion of the Oriental Daily News , Hong Kong police 's recent efforts to cut down five of the so - called so - called leaders of the Triad branch or district team leaders within a short period of three weeks have demonstrated the Hong Kong police 's determination to eradicate criminal activities .
 Hong Kong police recently worked closely with Guangdong 's Public Security Bureau in Guangdong for intelligence exchange and carried out a series of raids and operations in the series .
 Hong Kong police launched a crackdown on triad activities from 18 July 2002 to 24 July 2002 including drug trafficking, illegal possession of arms, theft, burglary, robbery, sales of pirate records and obscene records, cigarettes and duty-free cigarettes, and trafficking of dangerous drugs.
 On 24 July 2002 police were reported to have dispatched over 100 staff to storm a propitiated dance and wine party at a disco nightclub in Mongkok, Kowloon where the dance was organized to settle some disputes between 2 Triad groups.
 Police eventually arrested 3 branch leaders and 14 core members of Triad.
 Police sources confirmed to the Xinhua News Agency on 25 July 2002 that all 17 arrested were still detained for questioning.
 The Hong Kong police source was quoted as saying that the operation was successful in netting all 17 people as a result of Hong Kong police efforts to infiltrate relevant gangs here .
 Police sources also intimated that the crackdown by Hong Kong police followed more crackdowns on other gangs of Triad .
 Hong Kong police's efforts to fight off criminalorganization are involved in active cooperation with police on the Chinese mainland and in other regions.
 The first so-called targetted conference of the International Drug Enforcement Conference in the Far East will be held in Hong Kong in early July 2002.
 Hong Kong was chosen to host the event following a decision made by the IDEC conference at a meeting held in Bolivia in February 2002.
 Some 42 senior anti-narcotics officers from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Australia, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and the United States met.
 A Hong Kong police internal news letter recently reported that the aim of the conference is to provide a flexible and forward - thinking environment for information sharing and positive action against criminal transnational drug traffickers organized by organized crime .
 The exchanges of intelligence between Hong Kong police and Chinese mainland police are particularly intense.
 A delegation of 11 members of mainland China 's National Narcotics Control Commission recently visited Hong Kong to study how the police here enforce their anti-narcotics laws .
 The team , which includes 11 people , was chaired by Chen Cunyi , deputy director of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security 's Bureau of Narcotics Control , and briefed by Hong Kong police on the enforcement actions carried out in Hong Kong , and led by the head of Hong Kong 's Narcotics Bureau , Ip Lau Chuen .
 Hong Kong police also exchanged mutual concerns with China 's National Narcotics Control Commission and discussed a number of issues , including anti-drug trafficking and money laundering investigations .
 After meeting with Hong Kong 's Deputy Assistant Commissioner for Crime Yam Tat Wing , the mainland parties closed their visit and discussed further proposals for cooperation in combating cross-border drug trafficking activities .

 Peruvian military documents disclose links between former intelligence head Montesinos and drug trafficking.
 The documents signed by a high-ranking former Peruvian army officer and disclosed on 25 July 2002 mention drug trafficking links and could further compromise the situation of former head of Peru's National Intelligence Service Vladimiro Montesinos.
 A front page story in Peru's national daily El Comercio said Montesinos may have authorized drug dealing by military leaders in the Alto Huallaga region to find leaders of the rebel Shining Path group and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.
 Alto Huallaga is located northeast of the capital Lima.
 The story is based on a final report by the Attorney General's Office.
 The Attorney General's Office report collected accusations documents handed over by an unnamed Peruvian army general.
 El Comercio said the Scorpion intelligence operation was put into effect in 1992 by the then-president Alberto Fujimori's government to fight terrorism and drug trafficking in the Amazon region.
 Several agents infiltrated the group as part of the planned `` Scorpion '' event to gather information on the commanders of main rebels and drug traffickers.
 Additionally, transportation of cocaine that would have covered the agents was also ordered.
 Montesinos is a close advisor to former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori.
 Fujimori resigned in November over a bribery scandal and is now in prison in Lima on an alleged connection to the scandal.

 The recent raid on the People's Mujahedeen in Paris has been characterised by the French Foreign Minister as part of the fight against terrorism.
 French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin said on June 3, 2003 that the French government is considering a crackdown on the Iranian armed opposition People's Mujahedeen as part of an operation against terrorism.
 de Villepin said on French radio France Info that the People's Mujahedeen claimed responsibility for numerous attacks in Iran and that this dimension of terrorism cannot be hidden.
 De Villepin said the arrests were a decision of justice and that there are no diplomatic factors in this affair.
 De Villepin said the French people will act on the basis of strictly justice and determination in all their efforts to fight terrorism.
 On 22 June 2003 French police raided the headquarters of the People's Mujahedeen northwest of Paris.
 The People's Mujahedeen has accused French authorities of being part of a deal with the Iranian government to carry out the operation.
 The Iranian government has denied this claim.
 The 17 Mujahedeen members are now under judicial investigation for alleged links to terrorist organizations and funding terrorist activities.
 Some 160 people were initially detained as police cracked down on over 10 locations of the People's Mujahedeen in France.
 During the police raid a Paris map of streets related to the United States embassy which had been marked out, a bulletproof jacket, transmission equipment, more than 200 computers, and about 9 million American dollars in cash were seized.
 The People's Mujahedeen has been classified by the United States, the European Union and Iran as a terrorist organization.
 The People's Mujahedeen was formed in the 1960s by young Iranians educated in college and described as an Islamic left-wing organization.
 The People's Mujahedeen staged terrorist attacks inside Iran in the 1970s and killed several US military personnel and civilians working on defense projects in Teheran.
 The People's Mujahedeen was part of a broad coalition that initially supported the Iranian Revolution and participated in the 1979 takeover of the US embassy in Teheran.
 The People's Mujahedeen and the government have fallen out and since the 1980s the People's Mujahedeen have been building military bases in Iraq and political bases in Europe.
 The People's Mujahedeen has claimed responsibility in recent years for the assassinations of several people in the Iranian regime.
 These assassinations included the assassination in August 1998 of Assodalah Ladjevardi, the former director of Teheran's Evin prison in Teheran and the April 1999 assassination of Iranian army chief commandant General Ali Sayad Chirazi.
