 Resolutely support the person who started the thread, I replied with a poem I composed.
 pledge to fight to the death to defend the Diaoyu Islands and their related islands.
 A fishing boat was bumping into the fleet; they, with their thief-hearted hearts and form of arrogance, again showed their wolfish appearance. The evil little Japanese ghosts stirred up unrest and caused trouble.
 Never go back to that time when we made a humiliating appearance when we signed the treaty. China is strong! Sword and knife are sharp and shine! Let's bury the approaching enemy!

 I agree with the analysis of the thread starter. If war really comes, I would like to be Hua Mulan to protect our home, defend our homeland, spread the prestige of our China, and pledge to fight to the death to defend our national dignity. Bump up resolutely!
 I very much wish to be born during Mao Zedong's passionate, up-surging Long March, to lose my head, to shed my blood, to completely extinguish all the wrongdoers and enemies of China, and to spread our dragon prestige.
 How long are we going to tolerate Japan?
 I say to my fellow citizens:
 Hello everyone, We all know about the September 18th incident, but now again, Japan is premeditatedly planning another incident on the sea, similar to the Lugou Bridge incident, on the sea.
 Japan has surprisingly defied the whole world's strong condemnation and openly invaded our country's sacred territory, the Diaoyu Islands.
 As we all know, the Diaoyu Islands have always belonged to China. For historical reasons, what we originally belonged to has become a controversy.
 I asked my fellow citizens what our things were and why was there a need for negotiations. So Japan went even further, they wanted to create the fact of occupation. Can we allow this? Absolutely not.
 My fellow citizens, Japan's militarism brought grave disaster to the Asian people.
 Especially China, which suffered several decades of ravaging by Japan for a long period of time.
 In the Northeast, Japanese Unit 731 cruelly experimented on Chinese, Korean and other living people with extremely brutal methods on the human body. The Nanjing Massacre added a layer of blood that would never fade away to the ancient capital. A big bloody battle in Hengyang and Changsha bare the bones of the dead for over 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) and killed everything.
 When it comes to the heinous crimes committed by Japan in China, my fellow citizens, there are too many instances that are difficult to cite without exhausted all the bamboo strips being exhausted.
 Just like those 10 million dead souls who lost their lives wandered over the Pacific Ocean and found it difficult to rest in peace.
 Thus, all those who experienced that era still remember it vividly. At any time we turn to this page of history and read it, even our younger generation also cry tears streaming down our cheeks, and our blood boils with indignation.
 Now that Japan actually wants to reverse the verdict on its history of aggression, it has woke up fellow citizens and Chinese people in Asia.
 We must go on facing this shameful 100 years, even though it pains us to look back on this shameful 100 years. Let's create history, create and choose history, even if the issues of history are not resolved.
 Because of responsibility, we are not afraid. The territory is small, but it is a matter of dignity. The interests of the country and the national unity guarantee honor no matter how the wind and clouds change. We cannot let our native land be separated, even if it is scarred and wounded.
 My fellow citizens, the advent of the 21st century means that the Chinese nation is a time when we are beset by difficulties on the inside but pressed from the outside, and we face many challenges.
 How should we go about the Taiwan issue, the Tibet issue, the South China Sea issue, the surrounding environment, or aggressive foreign forces against China?
 What do I ask my fellow citizens? Please look at the world map, the crescent-shaped encirclement is suppressing our breath, strangling our development, and coveting our national territory.
 We don't want to make enemies, but we don't want to make enemies either. We don't want war, but we aren't afraid of war.
 We must urgently arrange arms and strengthen all military forces on land, sea and air.
 The Chinese nation has flourished for several thousand years, but it has never had the ambition to expand its territory outward.
 We follow a strategy philosophy of foreign security that applies benevolence and virtue, not wanting to impose our wants on others.
 It's like a country being tolerant and liberal is like an individual being tolerant and liberal - we must insist on not hurting others, but to avoid hurting others.
 Tolerance is certainly not fear, and sincerity does not have to be cowardice.
 Exempting Japan from war repairs caused by World War II will serve as a peace of benevolence.
 My fellow citizens , the People 's Heroes Monument is a condense history of a Chinese nation striving for continuous improvement .
 The solemn and magnificent posture represented a sacred expectation of peace.
 From time to time, thoughts of the many heroic and tragic scenes of shining spears and armored horses that have stirred up a string of memories agitate my memory.
 My thoughts go through that yellowed page of history, just as I see Kangxi, the famous generation-ruling Emperor, contemplate alone in his audience hall hundreds of years ago how to achieve the unification of the territories, and also Abraham Lincoln, the former U.S. president, wandering in the dark of the great hall, thinking of the integrity of the Union.
 To forget about war is certainly dangerous, but to be peaceful in the world, I would say to my fellow citizens that while we want development and peace, we must never exercise forbearance in a blind manner. The Boxer Protocol of betraying and humiliating the nation has aggravated China's poverty and backwardness in modern times. Falling behind leads to bullying.
 Where would peace come from without strength?
 We must focus on national defense education, build a great wall of knowledge at the hearts of the 1.3 billion people, and establish a full-range system that is capable of attacking and defending the nation.
 The best defense is attack defense. We should strengthen the forces that can engage in ultra-long-range attacks, improve combat capability in all aerospace at great distances and depths, increase defense industry investment and construction, accelerate the modernization and internationalization of military equipment, and establish elite high-tech and high quality high-quality high-tech divisions on the premise of avoiding influence on national economic development.
 The battle horn is about to sound, people are already fully equipped and ready to go.
 We have accomplished nothing without the support of the people, but we are all powerful with the support of the people.
 It's time to say no to other people, my fellow citizens, it's time to say no to other people, that's what we have to achieve.
 First , establish a guaranteed fund , improve the working environment and work mechanism , and recruit back to China the hundreds of thousands of professionals who have emigrated from the United States and around the world to the United States and are lingering in the United States in information technology .
 2) Create a few battle groups of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.
 3. 5000 advanced combat aircraft of various kinds of various kinds will be manufactured.
 4. Advancing research and deployment of high-speed intercontinental ballistic missiles with a range of more than 10,000 nautical miles (22,000 kilometers) that could break the missile defense system.
 5. Resumption of nuclear experimentation and establishment of military forces in space.
 6. retain 1000 nuclear bombs equal to 1 million tons of TNT and install nuclear warheads on all short and middle-range missiles when necessary.
 7. To retain 30 strategic nuclear submarines capable of inflicting 3 devastating nuclear strikes on the enemy.
 8. Abandon your commitment to not using nuclear weapons first.
 9. The right to pre-emptive strike is retained in the event of a threat to national security.
 We can strive to be strong only if we are confident in ourselves and improve ourselves, my fellow citizens! Qin Shi Huang unified China! Zheng Chenggong recovered Taiwan! We must carry on carrying on the far - seeing, insight and strong will of our predecessors!
 Now those pieces of land that tremble far away from the embrace of the motherland are shaking, moaning and calling. Let us carry forward, move forward, courageously, fellow citizens, carrying forward the wishes of the previous generals that were not fulfilled.
 As I read history, the heaviness and anger in my heart simmered as I read the history, causing national concern. Having been born to a cloth gown and being one of the common people, although I am willing to voluntarily serve our country for the sake of the motherland's prosperity and splendidness once again, I have no regrets even if I die. To show my sincere and patriotic heart to heaven is adequate.
 I composed the poem here in the classical form of "Ci" to voice my heart's aspirations.
 Paint a deep red lip.
 Protect the Diaoyu Islands!
 We bitterly lost our Ryukyu Islands.
 How can we allow the Diaoyu Islands to fall to other countries?
 100 years of vicissitude.
 Smoke and clouds were chasing the flying waves.
 The youngest brother is still a tender youth.
 It wandered off in all directions, bearing a seal.
 Look over at the flag.
 We brandished our weapons and crossed to the east.
 Let the horses drink from the Pacific Ocean.

 The other article titled "I have a dream Taiwanese compatriot, I have a dream" was titled "Chinese national heroes need a memorial museum or temple to be built for Chinese national heroes, how long will we tolerate it, China will never beg for the Olympics if the country expects it, there will be more history of hardship if we forget the hardship of history, I am a Chinese person, there is only one nation and one culture, the state can decline as sports develops, wealthy and strong, poor and poor, we need a memorial museum or temple for Chinese national heroes, we need stars of low-level entertainment and technological talent, the disgusting Ren Zhiqiang shut his filthy mouth, Li Yinhe hateful housing prices and people who can be depressed have no rights to make irresponsible remarks about the US, how long will we tolerate the US, Japan deserves to have Ban Ki-moon present a bouquet in Hiroshima, the strong anti-terrorist Ban Ki-moon presents a bouquet in Hiroshima, there is only one nation and one culture, there is only one culture, there is only one nation and one culture, there is only one nation and one culture, the state can decline as sports develops, there is only one nation and one culture, what is one nation and one culture, what is one nation and one culture, what is one nation, what is one nation, what is one nation, what is one nation, what is one nation, what is one nation, what is one nation, what is one nation, what is one nation, what is one nation, what is one nation, what is one nation, what is one nation, what is one nation, what is one nation, what is one nation, what is one nation, what is one nation, what is one nation, what is one nation, what is one nation, what is one nation
 Why didn't we fight the little Japan?
 What would the Chinese still tolerate?
 They even ride on our heads.
 Still do gutsy chinese people do this?
 We should tell the whole world that others cannot bully China at will.
 It is time for us to show our strength. China has been too long calm.
 Currently, our citizens' lives are all too carefree; officials are too extravagant.
 We already have no cohesion now. China needs to start a war. The face of countries that follow the rear of the United States will be slapped harshly.
 Let them know that the US is not a panacea. If we win, we can increase China's influence. If we lose, we can clean out incompetent bureaucrats and make the trash get out. And improve citizen cohesion. Let China have new blood and update. Let China get up.
 Go China!
 I suggest that China strengthen its guard of the Diaoyu Islands, guard the Diaoyu Islands daily, protect the fishermen and sovereignty of our country, and if Japan dare to invade our territory with military force, we will fight a small-scale war to defend ourselves, no matter what the cost. China cannot lose.
 We need shows in life, but it's really p. to show you how you're embraced by someone.
 I just happened to pass by.
 This is what a whole society, including the stars, is like.
 Damn it's not attractive.
 It is totally unacceptable.
 Agreed, they are just cheap entertainment people, their reputation in feudal China makes somewhat sense.
 Their lives look glorious.
 A group of 9 professions.
 Life is hard.
 Shocking.
 That's normal. Whores are heartless and performers are always self righteous.
 They want money, not face.
 Look at the wolf that was near Ms. Fan's glasses. You know, actors have to drink with him, without being forced out or even framed.
 SOB.
 Okay, as long as there's something to eat, and it's lovely.
 No one is easy, life is like a show, you have to look at the script to know how the performance is going to be.
 It's all somebody.
 In all 360 walks of life, there are top students in the Imperial Examination. How much effort and endeavor it is to be behind the top people in the Imperial Examination. This humiliates the word " bean vermicelli".
 Hahahaha.
 Overdoing it
 Reality.
 Shoot those hooligans!
 Cheaper than performers.
 Cheaper than performers.
 The entertainment circle is dirty, all the men in it are birds, beasts and scum.
 pity them, but who to blame? It's not easy to be a star female.
 Everybody does this, how can you make money if you don't do this?
 Women are proud to be in front of other people, but when they stay alone, they are in a melancholic mood.
 To put it plainly, nowadays's stars are just popular prostitutes, just like in ancient times; they are now famous prostitutes, so it is normal for them to just drink with or even sleep with some high officials.
 Stop talking to other people, just behave yourself.
 What should we do in the future too when we face such hard choices? Our capabilities alone are not enough to succeed.
 More suffering, more suffering disguised as a glorious look, is indisputible.
 It's not so bad because they just play in their own circles, without keeping things in mind, if they don't see things, they don't see them.
 But there is an old guy, Zhang Jizhong, an old guy whobehaves like a hooligan in his circle, and also thinks himself to be unselfishly virtuous. When he has nothing to do, he makes a TV series to wreck the whole country.
 Both take what they need.
 When was China able to have pure and innocent girls?
 The story is now very shocking in the entertainment world. There are rumors that Hsu Yuki was forced out for refusing to drink with the guests as arranged by the company, and that he had to switch to working as a lawyer's assistant instead to make the end-of-the-match meeting happen.
 The much envied and star-crossed superpowers often encounter social engagements or circumstances that they don't welcome but have to join in.
 After all, they can't decide on many things because it has to do with many aspects and the interests of many people.
 Sometimes what seems like a very normal dinner party to us ordinary people can be that simple for the stars, just as we imagine it to be.
 Star players have a lot of contracts and if they tackle well, their sources of money will roll in. If she doesn't tack well, force out or even frame, her heels will come off.
 There are two kinds of smart and starving female: those of the first kind always hold very high integrity and sternly reject all such invitations.
 The second kind of person is the one who is good at playing tricks and achieving their objectives with their seed money.
 There are rumors that even some super star-level female actors have won their first roles this way.
 After drinking some alcohol, advertisers or show sponsors may have a chance to lie on the star female's shoulder, feel her chin, or kiss her cheek, and that is the attitude she most adopt.
 They are the very people in the lower 9 professions.
 Those stars are just pretending and actually living a much better life than this!
 Agreed, they are just cheap entertainment people, their reputation in feudal China makes somewhat sense.
 Agreed.
 Oh well, actors aren't easy.
 They deserve it, they asked for that.
 It dawned on me that nothing would be easy.
 Women are birds and beasts, and men are worse than birds and beasts.
 BRAWLING!
 BRAWLING!
 It won't take long.
 The circumference highway, Route 288, which runs around the southwestern quadrant of the Richmond New Urban Region, was opened in late 2004.
 It already changes the development pattern as it gets worse and causes localised traffic congestion around its exits.
 The Richmond Times-Dispatch tells the tale of the impact of the Huguenot Trail in Powhatan County today.
 Will Jones reports traffic on one section of the Huguenot trail has more than doubled since 288 opened.
 speeding and accidents have surged as well.
 So far this year, 17 accidents have been reported near the Winterfield Road intersection, up from 12 in all of 2004.
 Dale Totten, a resident engineer with the Virginia Department of Transportation, noted that if the department had more money, it would have four lanes on the road at a cost of about $13 million.
 Of course, VDOT does not have the money to construct roads in the Richmond region.
 Because VDOT spent all their friggin' money on 288 because of local politicians and boosters.
 Where is Homer Simpson when you need him?
 This is a major moment, doh!
 As we predicted, Route 288 will generate residential development in all the scarce populated areas around and around its exit, overtaking the local roads of the country.
 Others chose where to work and live, but a limited access highway could relieve traffic for drivers driving back and forth between Chesterfield County and Goochland County.
 And they create traffic congestion in new places.
 I am surprised that this is only rapid.
 Even I think 3-4 years could be a lagging 3-4 years.
 Think about the liability that Route 288 would have created for all of its exits just because Route 288 has already created $13 million in road construction just at this one exit.
 Another prediction.
 After a few more years of scattered subdivision development and approval of a mega- commercial project at 288's intersection with a major road, the need for new road improvements will soar.
 We could well see the unfunded liability zoom past the $400 million originally taken to build the original highway before the end of the decade.
 " Route 288 was such a great idea," said a brainiac who thought Route 288 was a great idea.
 Thank you for nothing.
 I think we could have spent that $400 million elsewhere for better.
 I don't think you should blame 288 for creating those people.
 If they are enough to create traffic congestion in new places in new places, what is the alternative?
 additional traffic congestion in the old place?
 Now you understand how people like TMT in Fairfax feel.
 I usually take a pro-road position.
 But 288 is definitely an excess, with glaring needs in other parts of the state.
 Richmond has virtually no traffic.
 The rush hour hour is 30 minutes.
 And you give them a beltway through large rural areas.
 Road to nowhere.
 Just think how much of this money could be spent on another Potomac crossing facility or road improvements desperately needed in NOVA.
 [ Quote: Virginia Centrist · "The rest of the state helped to pay for 288 during the budget deal last year, adding insult to injury, because it wiped out the debt."
 It's very nice to have you all obliging us.
 Doesn't make much sense, though.
 It's the same old problem.
 If you get ahead of the need, you get accused of causing the sprawl.
 It is claimed that if you build in a place where there is already acute need, you cannot pave your way out of congestion.

 That's a fair point.
 5:26 is a good point.
 But this situation has hammered home the validity of state auditors’ reports that found CTB and VDOT funded transportation projects based on the best lobbyist rather than a comprehensive transportation plan for the state.
 I submit this is a disgraceful situation that should not be tolerated.
 And to make this worse, Senator Chichester and his toadies are pouring more money into this flawed institution.
 What is the purpose of transportation expenses?
 In Virginia it was for the benefit of the private business plan and not in the service of the public interest.
 You all are dead wrong.
 No less a person than Walter Stoch stated that 288 is intended to be paid for with economic development money.
 C'mon folks...
 I don't understand your point, TMT.
 When was the last time you were stuck in traffic not going to or going to some sort of business?
 The whole point of the road seems to me to be to facilitate the public's interest in getting into and out of private businesses.
 Business support is overwhelmingly needed, even after a Sunday drive, a trip to the grandmother's location, and, of course, a soccer game.
 No wonder we suffer congestion problems, our road expenditures don't match the increase in business or state GDP.
 If we recognize that the primary business benefit of the road is business, then we should do two things:
 Of course, businesses will pay more into our transportation bills, but even if that means more travel overall, incentive them to locate themselves where they are least stressful to the system.
 Why is it so hard to understand?
 Solutions to the functioning human settlement pattern and the balance between the capacity of transport systems and the travel demand generated by the use of land.
 All else is a lie.
 EMR
 TMT: In Virginia, it was for the benefit of the private business plan, not the public interest.
 I don't see the point of this statement, as it appears to demonize the private business plan and put the public interest above all else.
 I think they are tightly intertwined, so they are virtually the same.
 Local problems are obvious, as these cookie doughs are lumpy.
 But in the aggregate, if we demonize business long enough, we will eventually find that all of us are working for the devil.
 I don't see the point in claiming that a solution is a solution to a balance that is dynamic and ever changing.
 Even you would see the positives of rail to Dulles as a job center, promoting bidirectional demand for rail.
 I agree.
 In fact, that may be the reason it was built, all on it's own.
 All I'm saying is that the exact same logic should be applied to the road.
 They should have a destination on both ends so that we can use our investments to the maximum.
 We need more places to go to to get closer to the balance you say we need.
 Reality checks here.
 I drive past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.
 I commute back and forth to where I work on the Huguenot trail.
 I've never seen anything remotely like a traffic flood.
 It's a 55 mph zone, how many cars do you see 75-100 every morning?
 There is already a plan to widen the Huguenot Trail because of heavy demand from development on the Chesterfield side, new schools, and a whole bunch of existing development that was zoned and funneled through Robious Road years ago.
 288 would be wonderful for those of us who actually use it, rather than the bottleneck that Powhatan and West Chesterfield have with their lack of roads.
 We can develop commercial development and our work could be closer to our lives.
 You can think of that as an irrational use of land.
 I have no desire to live in any city.
 I refuse to work in the downtown area.
 I refuse to use mass transit, which is unsafe for female commuters who work long hours at irregular hours.
 And I seem to like the development of large lots.
 I don't understand exactly how I'm supposed to keep a horse on a 1/4 acre lot.
 One gallon of gas can go for $10.
 And I still pay to live in the country.
 Many people have a legitimate preference for horses, hunting, gardens, and certain types of small businesses, which makes them not want to live in the urban core.
 This infatuation with living in the city truly baffles me.
 Anonymous 6:37 PM · You have every right to live in the country if you wish to.
 But you have no right to have the rest of the state underwrite the construction of a $400 million highway to make shopping and getting to work easier.
 What else is being overlooked in the 288 debate is consistently being overlooked in the $400 million that could be spent on 288.
 If the money is applied to other pressing road projects, or even (god forbid) no road projects, much traffic congestion can be alleviated.
 Ray Hyde, My comments are directed at the investors who lobby for roads to be placed near their property and the incompetent system that funds these requests whether they are linked to a master transportation plan or not.
 I'm 24, and I have a 2.5 year old daughter.
 I've been breaking up with my son's father since August.
 I wanted to start dating other people, and my son's father said he would have nothing to do with it if I did.
 He is very possessive and controls, but he has no right to be because we are together.
 There's too much going on in his life right now, and although I've told him several times that I don't love him and he doesn't love me, he thinks we can work together.
 I want him there for his son without needing me too.
 But he has no one, his family doesn't get along with him and they have their own issues.
 I don't want to be miserable anymore and the longer he's around the more miserable I will be.
 I don't want him not there for his son because he is a good father, or at least tries to be.
 I believe every child needs both parents, whether they be together or not.
 But he thinks no one can have me if he can't have me.
 What am I going to do with my life moving on?
 It's very bad that your ex-significant other is threatening you using your son.
 You must not give in to that, because if you do it will just escalate it.
 You have the right to live your life and be happy, don't cave in to his threats.
 If he really does love his son he would see him regardless, but this is just a typical control method that people like him use.
 Others have said things like "I would kill myself if you left me" Does it get through to you?
 SetC-WP-01
 Meet all kinds of people.
 Do what you want.
 If he voluntarily walked out of both of your lives at the price of his life you would probably be better off without him.
 I agree, the other thing is that it's not his business whether or not you're dating.
 I didn't tell him.
 Not because he's a threat, but because he's not concerned about your personal life.
 Can you document his threats?
 You really need to.
 Quit taking his calls and make him leave a voice mail.
 Make him email or text you.
 Keep that record.
 Get a lawyer and divorce.
 Try legal aid if you can't afford one.
 Tell your ex-significant other that all communication needs to go through a lawyer.
 The bus driver, the person at the till, and the person delivering your food all want exact change.
 They don't realize you don't get a pile of change in the bank?
 Would someone have to take a note somewhere?
 People get lazy.
 I like to be near as near as possible because I don't like to count copper all day all day.
 If you take a £20 note on the bus they will just tell you to get off because they are lazy as hell.
 It is illegal to pay a certain amount in a load of coins, you can only pay something like £30 using a penny.
 Hello, I started University in September, but like most people, I obviously didn't immediately gel with it.
 However, I know that it will take me some time to adjust, as I'm a very introvert, shy, anxious, and always anxious, especially compared to the rest of the rest.
 All my housemates and I went out the first night I was here and it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
 When I was sober, I went to a student union union bar on my own.
 But more to the point. Here's the fact:
 After about 5 months here I'm not enjoying University, the courses are disillusioned, I'm not enjoying the set projects and I don't much like the course deliveries.
 University makes it much better than it seems it is.
 Bad start to the first term: Student financing has been delayed, adding to my level of stress, and I'm so worried I'm not able to progress in work because of all the pile up.
 I was assigned a counsellor at uni and I saw her for about 5-6 weeks in block sessions, and to be honest, it didn't really work out because I never opened up to her.
 Only half hearted.
 Now I'm loaded with work on my neck, have to hit a major deadline, depressed, and the anxiety results in me feeling miserable all the time.
 I no longer have a counsellor because you can only have one in so many sessions at a time, and I doubt they would help me much this time if they didn't already help me.
 I lack motivation, I don't feel comfortable with my lecturers, I feel like I want to give up, but I can't bring myself to give up because I ended up in a dead end job and I aspire to be someone.
 I would rather die than be uneducated and not live the life I wanted to live and make matters worse by dropping out of uni.
 I'm 21, I'm turning 22 this year, I don't have much time left to fail, I have to do something.
 I failed at college once and had to do another course to be able to get into university. I don't want to go through the system over and over and consistently fail.
 Can someone please give me some advice?
 Maybe go and see your doctor and see how you can get your deadline extended to try and ease the pressure a bit.
 Send an e-mail like this post to your tutor and have him consider the mitigating circumstances. Don't worry, they have seen all of them before, some of whom are much more uncomfortable with admission. I know as I used to work in the University administration department.
 Break up your work into chunks you can manage.
 concentrate on one bit of work at a time, obviously start with the most urgent assignment.
 Don't shut yourself off from your housemate and do well, try new things from the very beginning, now keep it up.
 You should go see your doctor, too.
 You may benefit from speaking to someone, if you've always been an anxious person, it might benefit you to speak to someone. My friend gets therapy on the NHS because of anxiety and it's really normal for her.
 Try to get the deadline extended, and be honest, I'm sure your University will allow it.
 It gets hard to keep strong and keep carrying on with life.
 My mum divorced her husband, she had a horrible time with my stepfather and the new freedom she found sent her round the bend.
 She is Epilepsy, manic depressive, with huge anger problems.
 She is constantly horrible to me.
 When I'm at home I can't cope with her outbursts and nasty, hateful remarks.
 I'm an 18 year old who has a 95% bursary and is in 6th form full time at a high pressure private school, at breaking point.
 I can't work at home because she shouts at me.
 Then I got angry with my teacher.
 She's lovely one minute, like I'd have my mummy back, then the next minute she turns into the meanest, most spiteful living human.
 I didn't pass my A2 exam and have already accepted that I was defeated and that this year has made me fail.
 Who knows, maybe I can come back from this back, who knows, the university offered me the most amazing offer, but I couldn't even accept it. I never made the grade.
 I wish I could wipe her out of my life, things would be so much better without her.
 But then I think I'm just being selfish.
 But surely this wasn't meant to be like my life, was it?
 It should have been so much better.
 But I feel like I have no control over this downhill spiral.
 And I don't know what to do.
 Thank you for reading.
 Nice vent.
 You can't get a section on her for that reason.
 Does she even have a history of mental illness or diagnosis?
 You surely don't know you wouldn't get a good grade, so if you can, accept the place if you can.
 Life throws things at you all the time.
 If someone is not part of your family, they are outsiders.
 I had to deal with verbal abuse from my dad for 8 years before I came to uni and honestly the only reason I'm here is because it's the only way out.
 If you really want to be out, you work hard.
 It really sounds like you need support from somewhere else if she can't consistently give you it.
 Can you call Childline or something like that?
 You can go to the library on Saturday and study for a good 8 hours.
 Can you go to your friends house to form a study group?
 You want her sectioned because it's a bit of pain in the ass and you blame it on all your problems?
 I know how you feel.
 My mum spit out of hell too.
 I highly recommend taking up smoking.
 Oh, tsr, grow up and stop nagging, it's a joke.
 I think over the past year or two I've become much weaker as a person and have in a way dulled my personality down to trying to make friends with some people at uni.
 But being overly nice to people leads them to believe they can say or do whatever the hell they want to me.
 They show absolutely no respect.
 For example, I say hello to someone from uni and they ignore me, but 30 minutes later they decide they want to help me out with some work and I give them that.
 It has caused a lot of anger and distress in my life and really started to affect my concentration at uni.
 Has anyone got any experience of how to handle this sort of thing or how to go about gaining some respect again?
 You just said no.
 If it is particularly uncomfortable for you, then gradually do it.
 You can start here: "I'm sorry, but I'm busy.
 Of course you don't go over the top with it, to not go completely the opposite direction.
 If you think no, in your mind, you say no.
 When they start to realise that you don't bend over backwards for them they will start to respect you more.
 Well, this really is such a bad attitude, of course, if you're nice but not nice to the point where you'll just let them do anything to you, that's not nice, but that's just you being a fool.
 I don't know if anyone has read this, but I just feel desperate and feel I need to tell someone.
 I left home in September and started at uni, I was incredibly anxious about doing this but delayed thinking about it until I got here, now I am here and have been for over 2 weeks. I feel terribly overwhelmed by it all and feel unintelligent and socially awkward.
 Since moving to secondary school I've been in an emotional struggle for the majority of my life, I lost my dad around the age of 9 and I used to always blame it for my feelings, since moving to secondary school I've had two periods of counselling in my life, in roughly 15 months from December 2009 until around March this year.
 I feel at the moment like the problems in my life are insurmountable and I am ever more doubtful of my always low self-esteem, I am unable to concentrate on work, often find myself becoming very quiet on social occasions and doubt myself over anything and everything.
 I have not been diagnosed by my 2 counselling counsellors as having depression and they have suggested I not suffer from it, but it is a huge worry for me as the depression that caused my dad to die by suicide caused me.
 I have tried to solve my problems before, and have found exercise and meditation particularly useful, and have also tried things like self-help books and tapes, but generally I feel like this is what I live in general, I waste my one chance to exist and my one chance to be a young man, these feelings beat away at me.
 I simply don't know what to do, and when I think of what to do I never follow through on it, and my friends often say I'm lazy, and I can't disagree a lot of the time. I feel like people are trying everything anyone can do to help, and I fail time and time again.
 Sorry to anyone who has read this jumbled mess of a mess, and I feel a bit like a moaning self-seeking self-seekers, but I truly do feel desperate.
 It is common for people's existing feelings to become more intense when they are in a new situation and feel under pressure to socialize with strangers and fit into a new role such as a university student.
 I am not a health professional and can only speak from my personal experience, so I strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional about how you feel and worry about depression.
 Most people feel unintelligent and awkward when they first get to uni, so you're definitely not alone there, but I really recommend you get an appointment with your uni counselling service to get counselling at your uni. It really doesn't really matter if anyone tells you whether you're depressed, you'll obviously have some problems at the minute and can use some support, meditate and exercise is really helpful so try to do that, but you have to engage with help and life in general to get somewhere, but don't beat yourself up over feeling like you're not motivated to do anything at the minute, a lot of people feel like this and hopefully it will pass as you begin to feel better as you begin to feel better. But the label isn't as important as your experience. You're not being kind to yourself, it only makes you feel worse.
 Good luck.
 I think a lot more people feel the same way as you do, but medicate themselves by using friends, i.e. medicate them using friends. It's probably not a solution as such, but it's definitely better to be around friends when you're depressed than to be alone and depressed, either way, if you fancy a chat, feel free to message me privately.
 If I were you, I would focus on idols, you aspire to someone like someone who came from a bad background and ended up successful, happy, had a family, married, etc. You don't want to be them, but someone you admire and respect.
 Focus on what you have achieved in life. You have not stated what you studied, or indeed why you studied, do you want to experience? Do you want to go? Does your mum want you to go? Do you need a degree for the career you want?
 Either way, sum up why you're there and work your bottom off to get the best grades possible because once you get your degree, you'll have something you can say (hey, I didn't fail, I worked hard at it and passed)

 I hope this helps.
 I'm pretty much not autistic (I haven't been diagnosed with dyspraxia, but I think I was misdiagnosed by a doctor) but I walk on my toes nearly all the time.
 It's more comfortable for me.
 What makes them decide that a toe walk is a sign of autism when it seems so random and doesn't always indicate anything?
 Well, I can have signs of something on the autism spectrum, but one or two?
 You guys know what I mean.
 Walking on toes may be an autism symptom.
 A headache could be a symptom of a brain tumor.
 Feeling tired a lot of the time may be a symptom of leukaemia.
 symptom's don't always apply, but if there are a lot of symptoms (which there are clearly in a lot of cases, such as in this instance) then it is worth noting, otherwise nothing would ever be diagnosed without a note.
 I used to walk on my toes, but that's because I was born with a strange toe that curled under and had to be straightened out by surgery two years ago.
 My brother is autistic but I haven't noticed it either, but the spectrum is so broad, and I probably have mild Asperger's, so I have communication problems and don't pick up on social reaction/body language.
 But then again, I don't have the proper diagnosis, and you may even have some symptoms, which doesn't mean you have a certain condition.
 I was told not to walk on my toes for years, so I don't walk on my toes much.
 I have dyspraxia.
 So you might be dyspraxic or have a short tendon.
 It's been drilled into those who do dance/ gymnastics/ballet/etc. to the point where I find it more comfortable now.
 I don't read too much into random symptoms like that.
 Hello, I'm a 12 year old girl who will be 13 in 2 days, and I am an addict to self harm.
 I started cutting each individual finger off with a scissors when I was 7, and never stopped from that day on.
 It's made worse because I have a scar on my leg from slitting a staple in my ex boyfriend's name because I wouldn't stop cutting if I bled.
 I have several slit arms.
 They healed and I then cut myself with a staple I stole from a school robber and a razor blade.
 I took around 5 paracetamol and other drugs and took them with lager and vodka, when I couldn't find the cut.
 I was really tempted to cut my arms off or burn myself as I wrote this.
 I'm an addict, I cut again while healing one.
 I think about it every day.
 I'm 12, and I'm already sick of my life.
 This is the source of this: my dad left when I was 7 and doesn't want to know me anymore.
 He just cares about his new little girl, his wife, and his new life, where I don't want to be.
 My best mate died when I was 10.
 I was in a relationship with a 16 year old boy and he was forbidden from speaking to me because of what had happened and the age difference.
 My mum also suffers from Bipolar and I have depression.
 I don't want to stop.
 I don't care what is done to me, I want it done time and time again to torture me, I hate myself.
 But I do love my best mate loads and he means the world to me and if I do anything he will do it.
 I didn't tell him, but he found out.
 I don't want to hurt him, I don't want him to hurt himself.
 What would I do?
 Thanks for reading.
 Are you on any drugs or do you get any therapy for it?
 You should talk to your school nurse or your GP and tell him what's going on.
 There may be people in the school who you can trust and can tell who is a school teacher.
 People can help you if you tell them.
 If you keep it bottled up inside, it will likely only get worse.
 Trust me, it would be better to get these things out as early as possible rather than let them get even worse.
 Please do not do this.
 I was 17 and started self harm last year, mainly cuts to my arms, but I stopped it a few months ago.
 It's hard, but you can do it.
 I feel so much happier now, but seeing the scars reminds me of how I felt at that time and how strong it was that feeling that made me want to do such a thing to myself.
 And also strong. You can do it. I found it saved by writing poetry and keeping a journal.
 Self-harm is addictive, but you can overcome it.
 Remember, self harm does not define who you are.
 You can overcome it.
 I've found in the past year that every time I go out, especially to university, I always check what I'm wearing to make sure I'm not losing anything or leaving anything behind, so I think I've got a form of OCD.
 I often have to check twice a go, and then for some reason I can't resist checking again after 30 seconds.
 Why is this?
 Am I crazy or something?
 It happens most often (when it does, but rarely) and even then it's still checked many times a day, if not many times a day. Is this OCD to any extent?
 What can I do about this?
 If I don't check I get very anxious and sort of go away for 15-30 minutes after but there is often much anxiety so I can't wait that long.
 I feel doomed or I feel doomed if I lose my wallet or my phone.
 I just wish I could be able to go out without worrying about whether or not I'm leaving something out or losing something every two minutes.
 I don't really know what to do and am afraid to go to a GP.
 They will probably never hear of some compulsion like this, and I just don't know what to do.
 Do any of you have a similar ritual?
 People think I'm crazy, but it's very strange how you get out of this.
 What advice can you give me?
 I used to do this on my way to college, I had a list of items I knew I had to have on me, and I was used to compulsive checking on the bus.
 I have more severe anxiety now and I think this is a warning sign, so just try to wean yourself off the habit when it is relatively fresh and definitely visit your doctor, but also tell yourself not to keep checking these things, I know it's easier said than done.
 Don't worry about that, the doctor will see a much worse case.
 :P :P I did OCD in psychology class today.
 One way to get rid of it might be to just avoid acting compulsive, so don't check if you're losing something and just leave it at that.
 While your anxiety level will increase for the duration, it will gradually decrease, so hopefully your OCD will disappear over time.
 That just sounds to me like you're over anxious, rather than having really bad OCD.
 I am very obsessed with security, to the point that I get up 20 times a night to check that all the locks in my house are locked, particularly in regards to keys.
 Sometimes I'm convinced they aren't locked, but I know they are.
 I think it will become a real problem when the obsession really starts to interrupt your daily routine.
 Don't worry, you're definitely not crazy, and I'm sure your GP will understand the issue.
 I also go to therapy for other reasons, and they encourage me to pick a number, which is obviously less than 20, stick with it and cut down.
 I think teaching is a good idea and I would still be ok if I had to do 5 or 20 checks.
 I'm a lot better so far, and I think there is definitely hope that anyone who wants to improve can.
 I'm usually pretty calm about things, I like to take things as they come and not worry too much.
 But in the last month or two, I've found myself becoming really anxious about things, and I'm not talking about merely feeling nervous out of the blue.
 I'm beginning to feel irrational panic about a variety of things that I didn't worry about too much beforehand, things that don't even come to mind as something that would cause bells to ring alarm bells in my head.
 I'm not sure if this is due to lifestyle changes (going from a carefree student to an unemployed graduate) or if this is a sign of other issues, but it has begun to bug me as it affects my confidence and happiness.
 I've spoken to a few people about it, including my parents, but all think the same, I'm going through a random phase and should hold off action until it's clear there is a serious problem.
 So what is the best thing to do?
 Do you speak to your doctor about it and see if an anti anxiety pill can take the edge off things?
 See if I can speak to a counsellor?
 Or should I take the advice of a close person around me and just keep an eye on anxiety just until it becomes a problem?
 Well, you should not start trying to keep an eye on your anxiety, as that will make you tense and more likely to panic, and there is a death circle there.
 As soon as you start feeling a bit panicky about anything, I recommend you try to focus on something that will guarantee that you'll smile or feel happier.
 Or if you can't do that, get one of your friends to make you laugh when you start to feel panic. It works for me and I've suffered random panic attacks ( lol).
 I just started to get really worried about the tiny thing, even though it's not as severe as you sound like it is.
 I find talking to someone else about what makes you anxious just might help.
 I found a way to mention what I was worried about to my mum and see her react to the situation as calm as I should have, which made me feel better about it and make me know that it's not a big deal and I don't need to be anxious about it, but perhaps not moaning.
 But if it gets worse, go to the doctor.
 I have a friend who suffers from severe anxiety that prevents her from leaving the house and doing things she might otherwise do because she is so worried about what could go wrong.
 The doctor gave her medication and it has made her much better.

 Some 2,500 mainly university students formed a human chain of Japanese characters spelling out "No War" in Osaka on Sunday to protest against the US-led military campaign in Iraq.
 "We can't forgive this war," Miyako Fuji, 20, one of the rally organizers, told the Jiji news agency.
 I want to join together with each of us anti-war individuals to feel the feelings of each of us.
 In addition to the 2,000 expected to show up at Osaka Castle, a park in the city's downtown neighborhood, protesters carried placards reading "Stop War, Love and Peace" when they formed a human chain after 5:00 p.m. (0600 GMT), Jiji news agency said.
 The protest followed a string of other protests that have involved tens of thousands of peace activists across Japan since January.
 A Kyodo news agency poll released Saturday said 78 of 100 people surveyed were against military action in Iraq.
 A separate poll by the leading Yomiuri newspaper published Tuesday showed 64 percent of adults felt Japan had no choice but to back the United States and only 12 percent said Japan had every reason to back the war.
 British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown on Tuesday named the current head of Britain's energy regulator as the new chairman of the Financial Services Authority's financial watchdog.
 Former senior banker Callum McCarthy will begin one of the most important jobs in the London financial world in September when the incumbent Howard Davies steps down.
 Davies left to become chairman of the London School of Economics, one of the best known and best known parts of the University of London.
 Brown said McCarthy would bring to the Federal Security Agency no rival combination of experience in the public sector, senior experience in the financial services industry, and the chairmanship of a highly successful regulatory organization.
 McCarthy is currently head of the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, which regulates Britain's privatised energy industry.
 McCarthy is a former top civil servant at the Department of Trade and Industry and previously held senior positions at Barclays Bank, BZW and Kleinwort Benson as well.
 In November 2001 the Financial Services Authority (FSA) became the sole British regulatory body for financial services taking on various functions from 9 separate agencies under Davies's watch.
 Tribal mobs hacked to death at least three family members in the northeastern Indian state of Tripura for allegedly practicing witchcraft, police said Thursday.
 The spokesman said between 25 and 30 armed group men attacked a house Wednesday belonging to a quack doctor in a village in the Tultuli region, 60 kilometers (40 miles) south of the Tripura state capital Agartala.
 The mob dragged out three members of the family and killed them with machete and spears before fleeing the area, the spokesman said by telephone from Agartala.
 Among the dead were 55-year-old quack doctor Nityalila Naotia, her teenage son, and another family member, who was unidentified.
 According to the spokesman, Naotia is believed to be a practicing sorcerer and to have cast an evil spell on the villagers with his black magic, prompting a group in the village to eliminate them.
 Police arrested 4 people for killing in connection with the killing.
 superstitious beliefs, black magic and demonology are integrated into tribal customs in parts of Tripura and other northeastern Indian states.
 Many tribes practice a faith that is believed to be mixed with black magic and superstition.
 30 dead in week-long non-stop rain in Oman
 MUSCAT, April 19
 30 people, including five Indians, four Pakistanis, a Pakistani and a United Arab Emirates family swept away in their car, died in a week-long unseasonally heavy rain in Oman, police said Saturday.
 A family of seven were killed when a wadi (dry river) overflowed due to rain in the Wilayat region near the border with the UAE, police spokesman Abdullah al-Harthy said: "We have recovered seven bodies and a vehicle."
 Five Indians and four Pakistanis died, according to Indian and Pakistani embassy officials.
 The decomposing body of Dharam Datt Choyal, a construction worker from the western Indian state of Rajasthan, was found Friday, said Bhupinder Singh, first secretary at the Indian embassy.
 Two other Indian workers were still missing after Choyal's truck was swept up in a flash flood Monday in the capital Muscat.
 Sixteen people have died since the rains began two days ago, police reported Wednesday.
 The sun was out on Saturday and traffic was normal running in the capital.
 Meteorological officials said the wet spell, which started with a bang on Monday, seemed to be ending.
 The largest market in Muscat, Muttrah Souq, reopened on Saturday, three days after it was flooded to the knees.
 A Pakistani court in the central province of Punjab has sentenced a Christian man to life imprisonment for blasphemy, police said Sunday.
 District court judge Shahid Rafiq of the Faisalabad industrial city found Ranjha Masih guilty of defacing Koranic verses during a 1998 protest rally by the minority Christian community.
 The judge also ordered Ranjha to pay a 50,000 rupee (about 870 US dollars) fine in a verdict handed down on Saturday, they said.
 Ranjha was accused of tearing down a Koran-carrying billboard in Faisalabad during a demonstration by Christians after a Faisalabad bishop committed suicide under a blasphemous law in 1985.
 Pope John Joseph of Faisalabad, a Catholic who has campaigned against the law, shot himself in the head outside a court in the Sahiwal district when a judge convicted Christian Ayub Masih under the law in 1998.
 Ayub Masih was charged in 1996 with blasphemous blasphemy for allegedly defending the British author of the novel The Satanic Verses which has infuriated radical Islamic clerics who accuse Rushdie of defaming Islam.
 A Pakistani supreme court last year acquitted Ayub Masih who had denied uttering words against Islam or Mohammad.
 blaspheming is punishable by death under the Pakistani Penal Code.
 However, no blasphemers convicted in the country have ever been executed.
 Christian rights activists campaigning against the anti-law against law introduced by the late military dictator General Zia-ul Haq say it is mainly used to persecution of Christians or to settle land feuds.
 French beleaguered media group Vivendi Universal is in advanced negotiations to sell its theme park business to a US firm for around 1.5 billion dollars, the Los Angeles Times said Friday.
 The reports came as the money-lender said it planned to sell off the US unit Vivendi Universal Entertainment and other assets to focus on telecom activities and its French cable television business.
 The Times said Vivendi Universal is negotiating to sell its flagship theme park to the New York investment firm Blackstone Group, in the first step toward dismantling its entertainment empire.
 A Vivendi Universal official in the United States was not immediately available for comment on Friday.
 The Blackstone Group is reportedly planning to buy Vivendi's theme park division, including Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal Orlando, Florida, and Universal's interest in owning Spanish and Japanese parks, sources close to the negotiations told the paper.
 Blackstone already holds a 50 percent stake in the two parks that make up Universal Orlando.
 Vivendi this week confirmed months of press speculation that it plans to shed its entertainment assets, including the famous movie studio Universal and its TV assets, before the end of the year.
 Chief Executive Jean-Rene Fourtou told shareholders at a general annual meeting on Tuesday that the sale of Vivendi Univeral Entertainment is a major goal for 2003 and negotiations are already underway.
 However , Fourtou said he had not yet received a firm offer for his giant US music business , Universal Music Group , and would not take a final decision on its future .
 The group, once a French utility company, must reshape itself to slash its huge debt burden of around 18 billion dollars.
 In 2002 the group recorded a net loss of 2.2 billion euros on sales of 2.85 billion euros which was the biggest ever in France.
 Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom stressed Wednesday the role of Qatar in the Middle East peace process during talks in Paris with his Qatari counterpart , sheik Hamad bin Jassem bin Jabr al-Thani .
 Shalom told a joint press conference that strong relations between the tiny Gulf state and the newly-appointed Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmud Abbas could boost peace .
 We will discuss the Middle East peace process.
 Over their hour-long talks , Shalom said , `` we asserted that we are willing to do everything to do everything to return to the negotiating table '' with both Israel and the Arab world .
 Qatar is a very important country on this issue.
 He said he knew of the special relationship between the Qatari foreign minister and Abu Mazen, using the alternative name Abbas.
 Shalom's encounter with his Arab counterpart was the first meeting since the Israeli foreign minister took office on February 27.
 Qatar has economic links with Israel but does not maintain diplomatic relations , facing criticism from other Arab countries .
 Shalom flew afterwards to London for talks with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw.
 US President George W. Bush told Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien in a telephone conversation Monday that he looks forward to seeing him at an upcoming summit among major industrialized nations and Russia, the White House said Tuesday.
 Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the two leaders will discuss the upcoming G-8 meeting, the relationship between the US and Canada and other international concerns for days before the June 1-3 summit in France.
 Both said they look forward to seeing each other in Evian.
 They also touched on Afghanistan, the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the global economy, Fleischer said.
 Bush has not definitely postponed his visit to Canada, instead choosing to host Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who has endorsed the military campaign against Iraq, amid a chill in relations over the country's opposition to the war in Iraq.
 Chretien told reporters Monday that he will discuss a wide range of issues with Bush, who has not spoken with Chretien since late February, including Iraq, the upcoming summit of the industrial-power Group of Eight and aid to Africa.
 We are always a good term.
 "We disagree on just one item," the Canadian leader said.
 The prime minister and president are bachelors because India suffers from nature's curse, the provincial chief of India's main opposition Congress party told an election rally, reports said Saturday.
 Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and President Abdul Kalam have offended Hindu rain god Varuna by remaining bachelor, the Indian newspaper The Times quoted Madhya Pradesh Minister Digvijay Singh as saying.
 A bachelor president and an unmarried prime minister rule the country.
 Singh said a Hindu book shastra says that this is very auspicious and will cause widespread heatwave and drought.
 He added that President Kalam's bachelor status, rather than just Prime Minister Vajpayee's, made the country a dry, arid and infertile country.
 Retired general secretary of Vajpayee's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party Pramod Mahajan retorted that Singh's statement was beneath contempt.
 India has been reeling from a heatwave since mid-May that has killed 1403 people.
 The western desert state of Rajasthan also braced for a five-year straight drought there.
 The skeleton of a second baby was found in a rural home in Wisconsin where a 22-year-old woman's dead infant was discovered in a blue plastic container on June 8, officials said Monday.
 Kristin Scott, a mother, told police she had secretly given birth to two babies, one of whom was an unknown sex baby in April 2001 and the other a full-term girl on January 14, 2002 at her parents' home in Byrds Creek, Richland County.
 She was arrested Saturday by police in Abilene, Texas, where she moved with a friend on June 2.
 She was held on $50,000 bail on charges of first-degree reckless homicide and hiding a corpse when the January-born infant died.
 Scott told police she didn't tend to the baby and the baby died within 30 minutes.
 She said the baby had to die, according to the criminal complaint.
 The woman's parents, William and Nancy Scott, found the decomposing body of the first baby in their closet after going to look for a source of the foul odor in their house.
 According to the complaint, Scott told investigators he had moved those bodies sometimes into the closet of a house in Byrds Creek, into the trunk of his car, and into a closet at his apartment in Richland Center before moving around Texas.
 The sheriff's office did not release other details about the second baby.
 Palestinian security forces returned to positions they held in the Gaza Strip before the 33-month-old Palestinian uprising broke out, Palestinian sources said Monday, as Israel removed all major checkpoints from the coastal territory.
 Police officers, enjoying freedom of movement they have not known since the Intifada exploded in September 2000, have taken up their positions across the Gaza Strip, the source said.
 The Palestinian police took over all posts and positions they held before September 28, 2000.
 They have been free to move with cars and weapons for the first time since the start of the Intifada, the source said.
 The move marked a huge step forward in carrying forward a US-backed Middle East roadmap aimed at ending months of bloodshed and creating a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
 Police took up positions there and in the neighboring town of Beit Lahiya following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the northern town of Beit Hanoun late Sunday, he said.
 They are also deploying along the Israeli border.
 The handover will be a test of credibility for the Palestinian Authority, which must show that it means business when it comes to rein in hardline groups plotting attacks against the Jewish state.
 The Israeli Intifada (Israeli uprising) allowed free circulation of Palestinians on the trans-Gaza highway for the first time in almost three years as troops abandoned three major checkpoints across the coastal territory.
 Traffic flowed freely at the junction of Netzarim, south of Gaza City, and at Kissufim, near Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, and at the Guest House, just south of Deir al-Balah, after the army withdrawal.
 Three military checkpoints on a highway running the entire length of the Gaza Strip transformed the ordinary 30-minute ride from the south to the north from an ordinary 30-minute ride into a two-hour or three-hour grinding ordeal and came to symbolize the horror of the occupation.
 ``Israel has implemented most of the agreement except for a few issues , '' said the source , who pointed out that Israel still has not removed the two military observation posts at the Kissufim and Guest House junction .
 He said several other roads remained temporarily closed but there was free movement along the trans-Gaza highway.
 The Karni-Netzarim road, which runs east-west across the route, and a section of the highway that passes close to the settlement of Kfar Darom, just south of the Guest House junction, are still closed, he said, adding that they were likely to open in the coming weeks.
 Another road leading from the southern border town of Rafah to Khan Yunis would open within 10 days, he said.
 Israeli military sources confirmed that troops had installed gates at the crossroads of Netzarim and the junction of the southern Guest House, while addressing Palestinian complaints, but said they were only there for the time Jewish settlers needed to use the road.
 The ban on allowing Palestinian men under the age of 35 to move freely was still in force but was expected to be lifted later Monday or early Tuesday .
 The army also handed over control of the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt to the Palestinians , sources at the source said .
 Six Palestinian police officers were allowed to return to the Palestinian section of the border crossing which was taken over by Israeli troops shortly after the start of the uprising.
 While Israel will finally control the zone , the 1993 Oslo accord granting Palestinians autonomy measures must be managed jointly by Israel and the Palestinians on the Rafah border crossing to Egypt .
 Israel has manned the Palestinian section for more than two years but has in principle opened the crossing in principle for movement between the two territories but frequently closes it for rarely explained reasons .
 Five Iraqi civilians, including a woman, were killed Monday when their house was hit by a missile fired by a US-led coalition warplane, witnesses said.
 They said their house was located in Al-Azamiyah, one of the most populous areas in the Iraqi capital Baghdad.
 One house was destroyed in the strike and casualties were removed from the area.
 A new round of air strikes by the US-led coalition forced a new round of airstrikes on Baghdad at 2:30 p.m. (1130 GMT Monday)
 They said huge explosions were heard in different parts of Baghdad and air raid sirens sounded in the capital, adding that Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery began firing back.
 Coalition leaders have repeatedly assured that every effort is to make every effort to minimize civilian casualties in the current Iraq war, but at least 130 Iraqi civilians have been reported killed since it started five days ago.
 Five Syrian bus passengers were killed and 10 others injured Sunday morning when a bus traveling near the Iraqi border was hit by a US missile, other reports reached here said.
 The vehicle carried Syrian refugees fleeing the war in Iraq.
 Tornado kills 16 in eastern China
 Hefei, July 9
 Fierce tornadoes killed 16 people and injured 162 in China's eastern Anhui province on Tuesday night, sweeping through Wuwei County in the Anhui province.
 Tornadoes struck several towns at 7:10 p.m. Tuesday and 2:00 a.m. Wednesday, the state disaster relief office said.
 57 people were still being treated in hospital for serious injuries.
 Officials said the storm affected 23,681 people, destroyed 715 houses and caused an estimated direct economic loss of 24 million yuan ( 2.9 million US dollars) .
 To date, 1786 people have been transferred to safe places.
 Rescue teams, medical staff and relief materials including tents and food have arrived in the affected areas.
 Lack of precautions blamed for avalanche accident in northwest China blamed on lack of precaution
 <b>Menyuan</b> (simplified Chinese: <i>menyuan</i>) is a county in northwestern China, located in the northwest.
 Search continued Tuesday for two outdoor tourists missing in an avalanche in the northwestern Chinese province of Qinghai, with the main reason for the tragedy listed as a lack of precaution that had already left one dead.
 "The six tourists had no experience of climbing mountains covered with snow and had little knowledge of the terrain," said Deng Haiping, head of a state mountaineer administration organization in charge of rescue operations.
 All six members of the outdoor sports club in Xining, the capital of Qinghai province, were six people.
 One of the three survivors, Lu Shimin, said two of them had climbed such a mountain for the first time.
 They did not have a compass, altitude measuring apparatus, let alone special communications equipment usually used in the mountains, Deng said.
 He also said the deadly avalanche was caused by a bold idea that the snow slide was a bold idea.
 The accident occurred Saturday afternoon, when six people slid down from the high Daban mountain, which is 3,700 meters (10,000 feet) high, at Ertanggou in the Menyuan Hui Autonomous Prefecture of Haibei Tibetan Autonomous.
 Three survivors of the avalanche reported to police, who then started a rescue operation with the help of villagers.
 One body was found early Sunday morning.
 One of those on the missing list was in Hong Kong but his identity was unknown, the rescue headquarters said.
 Deng said he could take an id card with him , that his name was only known as Hung Zhihua , and that the local government was trying to find out his identity with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region .
 A fifth rescue team was dispatched to search for the missing and more than 140 rescuers are now involved in the operation.
 But thick snow and new avalanche signs hampered rescue work, Deng said.
 ``In the last three days we have found no missing clues but two helmets,'' Deng said.
 Officials in Los Angeles mull over ways to accommodate Katrina evacuees
 LOS ANGELES, Sept 6
 County and city officials in Los Angeles were trying to determine Tuesday how best to accommodate the at least 2,000 evacuees expected to be brought to the gulf coast in the aftermath of Katrina.
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina assembled key members of her administration and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa assembled key members of his administration over the Labor Day weekend to assess the possibility of hosting thousands of displaced families who survived the disastrous hurricane, officials said.
 Molina and Villaraigosa have committed to taking at least 2,000 evacuees.
 Local officials announced earlier that a Katrina evacuee task force will be created in Los Angeles city/county to assist survivors in the transition period, both immediately and in the long term.
 Emergency service offices in California, the federal government, city and county departments and non-profit organizations such as the Red Cross are coordinating local efforts.
 County supervisors and the Mayor jointly activated the Los Angeles County emergency operations center to prepare for an intensive response involving evacuation assistance.
 Dozens of people have already traveled to Los Angeles County from the ruins in Louisiana and Alabama and are sheltering at the nonprofit Dream Center.
 A newly formed task force will be prepared to assist with shelter, support services, information and coordination of private sector assistance to find more permanent housing for evacuees as soon as possible.
 Molina and Villaraigosa called on the private sector and non-profit organizations to help provide for the needs of children and families coming into the Los Angeles area.

 7 dead, 98 injured in eastern China tornado
 Hefei, July 4
 Seven people were confirmed dead and 98 others injured in a tornado that hit an eastern Chinese city Tuesday, disaster relief authorities said.
 Seven bodies, including three in Renhe township and four in Qinlan, were found in the debris of collapsed buildings, the state disaster relief office said in a press release Wednesday.
 All the injured villagers were being treated at a local hospital.
 Doctors said one of the 10 seriously injured was in critical condition.
 Officials are still calculating the damage in Tianchang, in the eastern Chinese province of Anhui, where tornadoes packing winds of 100 kilometers (60 miles) per hour destroyed more than 100 homes and forced the evacuation of at least three villages.
 Province Vice-Governor Zhao Shucong led a relief team to Tianchang Wednesday morning, promising relief funds, materials and medical assistance.
 Many Chinese provinces have reported disastrous weather in recent weeks as floods hit central and southern China, while draught persisted in northern China.
 Floods caused 233 deaths and destroyed 118,500 houses in 18 areas in 18 areas Monday, while a draught left nearly 7.4 million people short of drinking water, the state's flood prevention headquarters said.
 Residents evacuated after massive land slide in central China
 Yichang, Hubei, April 20
 About 200 people were evacuated Sunday night, threatened by an ongoing massive land slide in the central Chinese province of Hubei, local authorities said.
 200 sheltering people, including teachers and residents, were evacuated to a middle school in Gaoyang, said Du Honghui, head of the Xingshan County's land and resource bureau.
 The continued rain has triggered a slide of 60,000 cubic meters (200,000 cubic feet) of land.
 It caused 2,000 cubic meters of rock mud to flow, inundating a nearby primary school and a village with 37 homes.
 As of 2:00 a.m. Sunday, the ground floor of a classroom in a teaching building in a central Gaoyang primary school, with all the windows, pupils' desks and chairs damaged, was covered with a meter ( yard) of deep mud.
 playgrounds were inundated with 30-50 centimeters (yards) of mud.
 "Rescue efforts are underway and the land slide situation is being closely monitored," Du said.
 There were no reports of casualties as primary schools did not have classes over the weekend.
 Authorities have decided since Monday to suspend primary school classes for three days.
 So far, up to 106 mm of rain has fallen.
 Weather forecasters said the rain would continue into the coming days, continuing to swell the underground water expelling from the land slide site.
 Disaster relief staff expected the land slide area to get worse due to bad weather.
 Up to 141 mm of rainstorms have killed two people in the past three days in Hubei province.
 Motorcyclists swept away as they passed the bridge.
 Other people were killed in the lightening strike.
 The storm, which caused flash floods in some areas, affected nearly 83,000 people in 16 counties or cities in Hubei, the state government said.

 Nargis tragedy recounted by survivors
 YANGON, May 13
 Some cyclone survivors who came in hard ways from disaster-hit home regions to seek shelter in Yangon in the aftermath of the recent cyclone Nargis recounted their bitter experience of the recent cyclone Nargis, which stroke their area, survivors recounted Tuesday.
 Villagers in Laputta, in the delta division of Myanmar's Ayeyawaddy state, who escaped the Nargis death toll with much hardship said they had experienced a terrible human tragedy.
 Farmers in the village of Pinzalu, which lies far from Laputta, said they were standing up to the hardest hit township, which had total house collapse and high tide waves driven by a cyclone storm.
 He said that if he were carrying his two young daughters, he would have tried to swim to escape and that one of them had died shortly after in a violent storm.
 He has no alternative but to abandon his dead daughter on the waves and try to keep afloat for a long time holding onto a fallen tree branch nearby.
 He cried out when he found another dead daughter in his hand after the storm wind had stopped for a moment.
 He recalls how his parents were swept away by tidal waves when the tragedy started and he was left alone to live alone.
 "Many other people in my village were similarly swept away by storm waves," he said, adding that he walked out of the town of Laputta afterwards after witnessing all the houses in the village under water.
 In the face of hunger , he has not found drinking water and food , and is trying to survive on the juice of fallen coconuts .
 Another woman villager told local media she escaped by staying on the roof of a hut but was stroke by a falling bamboo in the wind.
 Those unable to stand the strike were swept away in a storm overnight.
 On her way to Laputta, she said she saw many dead on the way, estimating that three-quarters of the people in her village had been killed by the storm.
 She described how five people only remained alive in the nearby village of Yway Ywa.
 A teacher in the village of Yay Wai Ywa spoke to the local Weekly Eleven News, saying her village was erased hours after the storm started, adding that most of the dead were female.
 She said the whole village cried out in the storm: "If the world is devastated, the village will be devastated," and some family members died together in a series of road accidents.
 She exclaimed that she had not found her dependants in Laputta but was resting in some spoiled pavilion, a pagoda pavilion with a shelter.
 She said she had to queue for it, but some well-wishers donated the millet gruel.
 Local doctors worry about hygiene issues as tens of thousands of homeless victims dispose of the urine themselves, and in the health view, this also constitutes a threat to thousands of unresolved dead bodies.
 On May 2 and 3, the deadly tropical cyclone Nargis, which covered five divisions and states (Yangon, Bago, Ayeyawaddy, Ayeyawaddy, Haing Gyi, Pathein, Myaungmya, Laputta, Mawlamyinegyun, Kyaiklat, Phyarpon and Bogalay) and 45 townships in Yangon, the country's biggest city, sustained the heaviest casualties and infrastructure damage ever sustained by a tropical cyclone over the Bay of Bengal, severely hit the five divisions and states: Yangon, Bago, Ayeyawaddy, Kayin, Mon and Mon.
 According to an official death toll updated until Monday, a total of 31938 people lost their lives in the cyclone storm, 29770 remained missing altogether and 1403 were injured.

 The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reached an agreement with Iranian officials stating that there are no remaining issues and no ambiguity regarding Iran's nuclear program and activities.
 U.S. and European officials suspect Iran's civilian nuclear energy program is masked by efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce atomic bombs.
 U.S. and European officials suspect Iran's civilian nuclear energy program is masked by efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce atomic bombs.
 U.S. and European officials may impose a fourth round of sanctions on Tehran at the U.N. Security Council's most likely to consider the issue of Iran's nuclear energy program in September 2007.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) distributed a limited copy of the IAEA report before a meeting of its 35 members on 11 September 2007.
 The findings reflect an agreement between the agency and Tehran on August 21, 2007 that was publicized by Iranian officials beginning the week of 12 August 2007.
 The accord said there would remain no issue and no ambiguity regarding Iran's nuclear program and its nuclear activities.
 According to a Reuters news agency account the IAEA report said the steps forward in the work plan were a significant step forward.
 A senior U.N. official was quoted by Reuters as stating that the Iranian government's efforts to enrich uranium are slowing down.
 The IAEA report stated that Iranian officials must continue to build confidence in the scope and nature of Iran's present and future nuclear program.
 Iranian officials stated on August 30, 2007 that Iran will cooperate with the IAEA in order to be able to prevent a further round of international sanctions.
 Iranian representative to the IAEA Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated to the Fars News Agency in Tehran that the report emphasizes that there are no signs or evidence indicating that Iran's nuclear activities have been diverted and that all of Iran's nuclear materials are being audited.
 Some non-proliferation experts stated that the IAEA has ceded too much to Iran.
 Washington-based arms control expert David Albright and arms control expert Jacqueline Shire of the Institute for Science and International Security wrote in a criticism published the week of 19 August 2007 that the idea of closing the file violated fundamental safeguards principles and that the agreement did not specify that Iranian officials provide the IAEA with access to key people, facilities and documents needed to verify Iran's answer to the IAEA's questions.
 An independent expert stated that Iran's latest agreement with the IAEA to allow inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information falls short of Western demands that Iran halt the production of concentrated uranium which could potentially be used in a bomb.
 U.S. State Department spokesman Tom Casey stated that Iranian officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program but that the report could offer some new details or insight into the program's development.
 Casey stated that the nuclear program that has moved forward continues to move forward and shows that the Iranian regime continues to defy the international community.
 Most Western non-proliferation experts stated that the 070721 agreement contained little that could dissuade policy makers in Washington, London, Paris and Berlin from moving forward with another round of Security Council sanctions.
 Experts stated that many of the transparency issues reported in the August 21, 2007 agreement should have been resolved previously.
 Executive Director of the non-partisan Arms Control Association in Washington Daryl G. Kimball stated that the agreement addresses the problem of the Iranian government's pursuit of enriched technology and capabilities which could lead to the production of nuclear bomb materials.
 Kimball stated that the Iranian government is designing to deflect criticism and pressure and claim progress is being made.
 Iranian officials stated that with more sanctions there would be possible reductions by collaborating with inspectors.
 The Security Council voted unanimously to impose sanctions on Iran despite limits on the penalties demanded by the U.S. under pressure from China and Russia.
 Soltanieh stated in an interview on state-controlled Iranian television that the report and the measures make any other international organization including the Security Council irrelevant and unjustified.

 A document was distributed to the Nuclear Suppliers Group outlining Israel's proposal that the Nuclear Suppliers Group allow international transfer of nuclear technology to States that have not signed on to non-proliferation rules.
 The proposal could complicate the Bush administration's efforts to win an exemption for India to engage in nuclear trade.
 Israeli officials convinced key groups of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines allowing the transfer of nuclear technology to States that do not sign on to non-proliferation rules.
 Countries that do not sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) are prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade including the purchase of reactors, uranium fuel or yellowcake.
 The document outlining Israel's proposal was distributed to the 45 members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group in March 2007.
 The Israeli presentation was made without any paper allowing for official denials.
 A letter from the NSG chairman said the Israeli presentation was offered in the context of a debate within the group over an Indian official's bid for the exemption on 17 March 2007.
 India and Israel are the only nations that have not signed the treaty and Israel's proposal is eligible for admission to the NSG.
 The Israeli plan offers 12 criteria for allowing nuclear trade with non-nuclear States.
 One criterion indicates Israel's status as an undeclared nuclear weapons state and says States should be allowed to engage in nuclear trade if they apply stringent physical protection, control measures and accountancy measures to all nuclear weapons and nuclear facilities, sources and special nuclear materials on their territory.
 The documents circulated on Capitol Hill in September 2007 as the Bush administration worked toward an agreement with Indian officials.
 Executive Director of the Arms Control Association in Washington Daryl Kimball stated that the Israeli documents could affect the debate over India.
 Kimball stated --
 The dynamic at the NSG is that officials from the countries do not want to be an obstacle to India being the largest and most powerful country and the United States the most powerful.
 A consensus on India will be difficult to reach at an NSG meeting in November 2007.
 The Israeli proposal gives officials in some countries reason to suggest an alternative approach to specific exemptions.
 Israel's record of following international nuclear rules is good and India's is better.
 Despite ties between the Israeli government and the U.S. government, the Bush administration rejected Israel's proposal.
 The proposal could complicate the Bush administration's efforts to win an exemption for India to engage in nuclear trade.
 President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice view the pact as an important part of the Bush administration's foreign policy legacy.
 The deal is controversial in India and must be given approval by Congress.
 A delay in winning approval for the Indian deal could have a negative effect on the administration's foreign policy legacy with the most negative effect being a delay in the election year.
 State Department spokesman Tom Casey stated that the U.S. government views the Indian deal as unique and does not see it as precedent for any other country including Israel.
 Israeli embassy spokesman David Siegel stated that it is grossly inaccurate to suggest that the Israeli government is demanding exemptions or linking the effort to any other issue including the India debate.
 Seigel stated --
 The Israeli government has never asked the NSG for exemptions to nuclear supply guidelines or made specific requests for them.
 Israel is recognized for its full-fledged adherence to the NSG guidelines.
 The Israeli government urged the NSG to consider adopting a generic multi-tiered approach to nuclear technology transfer based on criteria.
 Some NSG officials have previously suggested an approach similar to the Israeli plan.
 The non-proliferation regime would be considerably enhanced if the NSG guidelines were modified as proposed by Israeli officials.

 Ahmadinejad announced an expansion of Iran's uranium production capability.
 Iran has refused to commit to halting the expansion but has hinted that the expansion may halt in the future.
 Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stated to scholars in the northeastern city of Mashbad on 26 July 2008 that Iran will expand its arsenal of enriched uranium-producing centrifuges to over 5000.
 Ahmadinejad's statement was Ahmadinejad's first assertion of expansion since it was announced in April 2008 that Iran was approaching implementation of 6000 centrifuges.
 Iran has articulate a goal of 50,000 centrifuges operating at an enrichment plant near the town of Natanz.
 The international community demands that Iran halt the production of nuclear material.
 Media reports differ on the number of centrifuges Ahmadinejad cited.
 The Iranian news agency reported that Ahmadinejad stated that Iran has 6000 working centrifuges but subsequently removed the statement from the Internet.
 Another Iranian news agency stated that Ahmadinejad referred to hundreds of thousands of centrifuges.
 Experts discount the significance of Ahmadinejad's claims due to the absence of information on the function of the centrifuge.
 A Western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity in Tehran stated that the number of centrifuges is less important than whether the machines are operational and whether they are efficient but that Ahmadinejad's assertion will hinder the resolution of the diplomatic standoff between Iran and the West.
 Arms control expert at the New America Foundation Jeffrey G. Lewis stated that the New America Foundation is aware of Iran's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but does not know the operational status of the machines.
 Diplomats and arms control experts stated that technical problems are hindering Iran's enrichment program.
 Iran has repeatedly asserted that its nuclear program's aim is only to produce electricity and that producing nuclear weapons is contrary to Islamic principles.
 The US, Israel, Europe and the majority of Western arms control experts believe Iran is pursuing the capability to immediately produce a bomb if the decision is made.
 Experts stated that it is relatively simple to produce weapons-grade uranium from reactor-grade material.
 Ahmadinejad stated that the West is still pursuing negotiations after Iran resisted Western demands to halt Iran's nuclear activities.
 EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana recently presented two offers to Iran.
 A package of incentives to cease the production of enriched uranium has been endorsed by the US.
 The 6-week freeze is a pre-negotiated period during which Iran will not add centrifuges and the West will refrain from promoting a fourth round of economic sanctions against Iran at the UN Security Council.
 Although the Bush administration recently agreed to a proposed freeze for the freeze and dispatched Burns to Geneva, US officials have repeated statements that negotiations cannot begin before Iran has halted all enrichment-related activities that are verifiable.
 On 26 July 2008 Iran refused to respond to Solana's offer during talks in Geneva attended by US Undersecretary of State William J. Burns.
 The talks constitute the highest-level diplomatic contact between the US and Iran in nearly 30 years.
 Solana, Burns and the European envoy set a deadline for a positive response from Iran before launching new sanctions including a prohibition on the sale of refined petroleum products vital to Iran's economy.
 Iranian officials have refused to commit themselves to stopping the expansion or observing the deadline.
 On 26 July 2008 Ahmadinejad appeared to suggest that Iran could potentially halt the expansion over a period of over 6 weeks at a higher number of centrifuges than previously expected.
 Ahmadinejad stated that the existing 5000-6000 operational centrifuges would be of no use to the West if the number of centrifuges did not increase.
 5,000 centrifuges could produce enough nuclear material for a power plant or an atomic bomb if highly enriched.
 6 6000 centrifuges continuously running could produce weapons-grade uranium sufficient for 1 bomb in 6 months.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency stated in May 2008 that Iran possesses 3500 operational centrifuges.

 The Paris diplomatic meeting concluded with no agreement on further steps to pressure Iran to halt uranium enrichment at the Iranian facility in Natanz.
 Diplomats stated to the media on 14 November 2008 that officials from the United States, Europe, Russia and China did not reach an agreement at a meeting in Paris on 13 November 2008 to further act to persuade Iran to halt uranium enrichment at Iran's Natanz facility.
 Uranium enrichment is a highly technical process that could produce fuel for nuclear power plants or could produce fissile material for atomic weapons.
 The meeting on 13 November 2008 ended with no new measures announced.
 After the meeting on 13 November 2008 the French Foreign Ministry released a statement declaring that the international community reaffirmed the importance of a dual track approach to diplomatic engagement with Iran and towards sanctions work on the dual track.
 Russia and China will resist new sanctions against Iran.
 Russia and China have close political and business ties with the Islamic Republic of Iran and do not feel any domestic pressure to act against Iran.
 There are no close political and business ties between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States feels domestic pressure to act against the country.
 Russia and China hold the veto power at the Security Council.
 Russian diplomat Sergei Ryabkov was quoted by the Interfax news agency in Moscow as saying that at the meeting on 13 November 2008 the parties would not strike a deal on sanctions against Iran and that while Western countries favor sanctions against Iran China and Russia do not.
 Sergei Ryabkov attended the meeting on 13 November 2008.
 According to reports released this week Iran has made significant progress on a heavy water research reactor facility near Arak.
 An Iranian heavy water research reactor near Arak could eventually produce plutonium which could be used for nuclear weapons.
 Satellite images published by the Institute for Science and International Security showed significant progress in the construction of a heavy water research reactor facility near Arak between February 2008 and October 2008.
 David Albright stated that the Iranian heavy water research reactor near Arak has evaded the notice of the international security community.
 David Albright stated that satellite images said that the Iranian heavy water research reactor near Arak has made significant progress and has progressed from a building frame to a large finished facility over the past 1.5 years.
 David Albright is a former arms inspector and the director of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security.
 Iran stated that Iran is pursuing nuclear technology to produce energy and conduct research.
 The United States and its Western allies suspect Iran's production efforts are a precursor to creating a nuclear weapons infrastructure.
 Producing low-grade uranium is legal under international arms control regulations.
 Iran's latest nuclear technology development shows a complex technical and diplomatic challenge facing the incoming foreign policy team of US President-elect Barack Obama's incoming foreign policy team in taking on the task of stopping Iran from mastering technology that could be used to manufacture and deliver nuclear weapons.
 Last month, when it was in power, the administration of US President George W. Bush managed to synchronize its policies with those of the leaders of the European Union, Britain, France and Germany to press for tougher sanctions against Iran and diplomatic action.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency is expected to release a critical report on Iran next week.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency is a United Nations nuclear watchdog agency.
 A new initiative on Iran's nuclear program has not emerged from talks in Paris on November 13, 2008 and hopes of imposing another set of United Nations Security Council sanctions before the end of President Bush's term have decreased.
 During the diplomatic maneuvers Iran continues to work toward masterminding nuclear and missile technology.
 Some Israeli officials stated that they were alarmed by Iran's test this week of a two-stage solid fuel rocket with a range of 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers) that was fired.
 Tel Aviv is less than 650 miles from Iranian territory.

 A high-security Russian laboratory complex storing anthrax, plague and other deadly bacterium faced the loss of electricity due to a lack of payment to the electricity utility Mosenergo.
 A large repository of deadly anthrax, plague and other deadly bacterium stored in a high-security Russian laboratory complex 100 miles south of Moscow threatens to lose electricity.
 Electricity utility Mosenergo officials in the Moscow region of Mosenergo recently arrived at a Russian laboratory complex and threatened to turn off the electricity because of lack of pay.
 The Russian laboratory complex is a 90-building campus and served as a secret site for secret biological weapons programs during the Soviet era.
 An incorrect headline in the Izvestia newspaper stated that a deadly virus from a Moscow regional depository has threatened Moscow.
 There is no virus at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology in Obolensk.
 Every kind of bacterium that is deadly has been studied at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology for use in the Soviet Union's secret biological weapons program.
 A large virus repository is located in Siberia.
 Russian and Western officials stated that power cuts at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology are unlikely to result in any threat to public health.
 Russian and Western officials stated that there is not enough certainty to be able to know if the loss of power at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is a threat to public health.
 General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology has quite a reliable and emergency protection system.
 General Nikolai N. Urakov is a longtime director of the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology.
 The State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is working with Western scientists to convert the complex into a biomedicine manufacturing site.
 General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that scientists at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology were scared of this sudden shut-down of electricity because of this kind of psychological pressure.
 General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that if power is shut down at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology then scientists will have to destroy all bacteriological experiments under way.
 General Nikolai N. Urakov would like the United States and Western countries, which have contributed about 6 million US dollars to the transformation of the former bioweapon complex, to contribute another 500,000 US dollars a year to pay the electric bills and arrears of the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology.
 American scientists working closely with the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology stated that it is the Russian government's responsibility to pay the institute's electric bill.
 In 1997 Western aid peaked with the conversion of General Nikolai N. Urakov's bioweapon laboratory at one time to Western aid when it was learned that Iran had offered to purchase experts from the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology.
 It is known that the sense of crisis is orchestrated by Russian scientists and military leaders who are now depending on Western financing to destroy nuclear, chemical and biological weapons in order to increase finance.
 American scientist Randall Lee Beatty works at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology in Obolensk.
 Beatty stated that this threat of electricity cuts at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is a crisis.
 Randall Lee Beatty is the director of the International Science and Technology Center.
 The International Science and Technology Center finances approximately half of General Nikolai N. Urakov's budget to support about 350 Russian scientists and technicians in biowarfare.
 Randall Lee Beatty stated that it is known that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology has not paid its electricity bills for 14 months.
 Randall Lee Beatty stated that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is one of the most important archives of dangerous pathogen information in the world and that the destruction of the institute due to non-payment of electricity utility bills is shameful.
 Approximately 30000 strains of bacterium are stored at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology and many of them are stored in cryogenic caskets cooled in liquid nitrogen and isolated from the environment in layered enclosures and oversize air handling systems that depend on electricity for their function.
 The greatest danger from the shut-down of electric power at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is that living germs currently preserved in a frozen state will be defrosted.
 Biological warfare expert at the Monterey Institute of International Studies Raymond Zilinskas stated that the main threat to the organism is the cut in power for the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology rather than the possibility of escape.
 Raymond Zilinskas stated that in the worst case the bacterium will defroze from minus 70 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and the cleanup afterward will be a real mess because it is certain that all the bacteria will die.
 Another example is the confrontation between the Mosenergo electricity utility and the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology in Obolensk, in which the basic capitalist imperative to sustain enterprises may be threatening to clash dangerously with the old remains of Soviet weapons science.
 An overdue power bill in 2000 caused the Russian National Power Company to cut off electricity to the strategic base where nuclear missiles stand on high alert.
 Nuclear missile silos do not lose power.
 Armed troops marched to the substation and turned the power back on.
 national company United energy systems cut power in January and February 2001 to a number of military installations around Russia.
 Military installations that lost power included a Kamchatka space forces monitoring center.
 In most cases, in the case of military installations where electricity was cut off, it was quickly restored.
 The investigation has often shown that there is a war tug between the utility and the military that forces the military to spend money on electricity power out of budget funds rather than divert the money to other uses.
 Some of the funds cut at times in the budget include building a residence in the country for the General, which has been included in the budget.

 Brazil implemented a law allowing the Air Force to target drug-trafficking aircraft in Brazilian airspace.
 The US is concerned about liability if civilian planes are misidentified.
 Brazil announced that the Air Force will begin shooting down aircraft used to traffick illegal drugs into Brazilian airspace.
 The plan requires eight steps of precautionary steps before the order to shoot down the plane can be issued.
 Prior to the policy taking effect in late October 2004, a publicity campaign notified ranchers and others that they would need to file a flight plan.
 The law permitting such action was originally approved in 1998 but President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of the year 1995-2003 never put the policy into effect.
 The United States dissuaded Cardoso from signing the decree out of concern that the accidental downing of a civilian aircraft could expose the US government and companies to a lawsuit.
 In April 2001 the United States reduced its previous support for operations targeting drug-running aircraft when a Peruvian jet shot down a small plane misidentified as a drug carrier and killed a US missionary and his children.
 Relatives of the victims sued the US government and won a settlement for providing intelligence and technical support for the operation.
 A US State Department official stated --
 US law may forbid assistance to countries that implement shoot-down laws under certain conditions.
 The US agreed with Brazil's assessment that drug traffickers' threats are very serious and increasing.
 The US government is consulting with the Brazilian government on US law provisions.
 Brazilian Defense Minister Jose Viegas stated that Brazil has encountered difficulties in securing US support for the plan but recent bilateral talks have led to certainty that the US government will accept the decree without exposing Brazil to commercial sanctions.
 Brazilian officials expressed hope that the US would endorse the policy before it goes into effect.
 The US is scheduled to provide Brazil with 10.2 million dollars in 2004 in drug and law enforcement aid.
 Former Air Force chief and current director of the Air Institute at Rio de Janeiro's Estacio de Sa University General Mauro Jose Miranda Gandra stated that the government took a courageous step towards the measure but that the impact could be more political than practical due to the restrictions that the Brazilian government imposes on itself.
 Brazilian officials stated that the policy may not apply against aircraft on which children were on board.
 Viegas stated that the limit was necessary.
 Gandra stated that the provision undermined the essential purpose of the decree by granting immunity to drug-smuggling aircraft carrying children and thus introducing the possibility of using kidnapped children as human shields.
 Viegas stated in an interview in Brasilia that the government will use laws to more powerful dissuade drug traffickers who had previously entered Brazilian airspace without feeling threatened by the Air Force.
 The deteriorating public security situation regarding increasingly powerful and violent drug gangs in Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro have prompted the government to take action.
 Rio de Janeiro's drug gangs have more firepower than the police and have successfully attacked police stations and forced businesses and schools to close.
 President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva stated in a 2003 interview with a foreign correspondent that --
 The policy is a matter of national sovereignty and security.
 Some pilots of drug-running aircraft felt so confident that they made obscene gestures at pursuing Brazilian Air Force pilots as a retribute.
 The law's constitutionality is in question under Brazilian law which prohibits the death penalty as a punishment for criminal acts.
 Some legal experts and other commentators stated that the statute amounts to de facto execution of drug traffickers contrary to the government's claims.
 The daily O Estado de Sao Paolo stated in an editorial the week of 18 July 2004 through 24 July 2004 that the extreme measures raise ethical and juridical problems that exceed any potential benefits.
 The penalty is applied extrajudicial under an administrative decision by the Air Force commander.
 These people gained a living and death power over crew members and regular, non-flying passengers.
 In 2002 Brazil inaugurated a $1.4 billion dollar SIVAM radar system that will allow the government for the first time to monitor air activity throughout the expansive Amazon region.
 The system uses American technology.
 Illegal flights initially declined by 30 percent due to concern about improved tracking capabilities for traffickers but have subsequently re-accelerated.
 Brazil has recorded 4,128 unauthorised flights in 2003.
 Some of these flights have been in violation of the innocents rights of ranchers flying between plantations in the Amazon.
 Viegas stated that there has been a significant increase in deliberate violations of Brazilian airspace by drug smugglers who appear to be aware of the government's inability to retaliate.
 In April 2001 Brazil's most notorious drug dealer and Rio de Janeiro's most notorious drug boss Fernandinho Beira-Mar was captured in Colombia in a gun-for-drugs pipeline involving leftist guerrillas.
 Brazil's northern Amazon corridor has become an increasingly busy and essential route for the global drug trade and is used to smuggle arms, gold and diamonds.
 One of the most important drug and gun smuggling routes to supply cocaine to Europe runs across Colombia and Suriname and is reported to run across the northern tier of the Amazon.
 Colombia is the only country that currently has a policy that targets drug-trafficking aircraft.
 Colombia is a source of much of the cocaine and heroin sold in the United States.

 The Venezuelan president's weapons deal with Russia, curbing military cooperation with the United States and plans to train as many as 2 million Venezuelan civilians to repel a possible superpower invasion have worried both the United States and his domestic critics.
 Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's weapons deal with Russia, his curbing of military cooperation with the United States and his plans to train as many as two million civilians to repel a possible invasion by an imperialist superpower have worried the United States and domestic critics of Chavez as well as former military officers on the left.
 Chavez insists the move is purely defensive and that the need to update obsolete military hardware and to protect Venezuela from nations that might want to control it is overdue.
 Venezuela is the largest petroleum producer in South America.
 Domestic opponents of Chavez have scoffed at the idea of a US invasion of Venezuela ever happening, charging that Chavez's true intention is to arm huge cadres of loyal reservists to protect him from any internal uprising and pose a militarized counterweight to US influence in Latin America.
 Chavez is a major ally of Cuban leader Fidel Castro and has grown closer to him.
 According to Chavez detractors in the US government, Chavez's purchase of arms and indoctrination in the civilian militia could be even more troublesome as part of a strategy to restructure Venezuelan democracy under a Cuban-style militarized socialist image that will foment a leftist revolution throughout South America.
 US military strategists say they are increasingly concerned that radical moves inspired by Chavez could foment such a revolution.
 The political mainstream in Latin America has shifted leftward since the late 1990s.
 This shift to the left is largely a reaction to the perceived failure of free market economics.
 The leftists were elected to lead Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Ecuador and Venezuela.
 Chavez supporters at home countered that the United States has a century-long history of openly and covert armed and covert intervention in Latin America's domestic politics and said the United States has no right to question Venezuela's defense preparation.
 Carlos Roque Espinoza Leon said the Venezuelans never asked what the US marines were doing.
 Espinoza Leon is a defense specialist who served in Venezuela's National Assembly and is a Chavez supporter.
 Espinoza said Peru has 500,000 rifles and no one has said anything.
 Espinoza said no one is complaining that Colombia is the most militarized country in Latin America.
 Espinoza said the US history is full of aggression in Latin America.
 "The Venezuelan people must do whatever is necessary to protect themselves," Espinoza said.
 Chavez has famously said that the so-called Venezuelan Bolivarian Revolution was peaceful, but armed.
 Chavez was first elected in 1998 and according to an independent firm called Datanalisis, his popularity rating is 71 percent.
 Alberto Garrido, a Venezuelan military analyst, said Chavez is looking to his allies in Russia, China and Iran to promote a multi-polar world to counter US dominance, encouraging grass-roots moves in Latin America to throw off US government influence.
 <b>Lorenzo Campos</b> is a farmer in the Anzoategui state of northern Venezuela and a reservist.
 Campos said the Venezuelans want the world to know that they are not prepared to attack anyone and are on a mission to protect themselves.
 In May 2005 Chavez's government announced details of a $18.6 million dollar deal with a Russian firm to purchase 100000 AK-103 assault rifles with 30 rounds of ammunition each with technology transferred to Venezuela for manufacture in Venezuela.
 The deal works out to $ 186.22 per rifle per rifle.
 This price is considerably less than the 825-850 dollars that the same weapons ordered through the US mail would cost.
 The Venezuelan government also intends to buy 10 helicopters from Russia, 10 transport planes from Spain and 6 naval craft from Spain.
 Venezuelan officials said the government is negotiating with Brazil to buy around 24 air support and training planes.
 Chavez insists on the purchase, and even his most staunch military critics here -- even his retired military critics here -- agree that the purchase is essential to update old weaponry such as the decades-old FAL rifles from Belgium.
 Retired General Fernando Ochoa Antich said it is exaggerated to say that Chavez is engaged in an arms build-up.
 Ochoa was defense minister in 1992 during the failed coup against then-colonel Chavez.
 Ochoa stated that Venezuela has not purchased arms in the past 25 years and said that Chavez is not aggressive and threatening to threaten his neighbors.
 Ochoa said that Venezuela has never bought arms from Russia before and suggested that Chavez is buying them to become independent from the US.
 Ochoa asked why Chavez bought the rifle caliber popular with subvertive forces in Latin America and stated that Chavez's political support for radical left-wing moves makes him a continent-wide menace.
 The US Pentagon openly questioned what Chavez was doing with the old FAL rifles and whether he could share weapons or ammunition with Latin American guerrilla forces.
 The US government has provided no evidence that Chavez armed or funded the left-wing insurgency.
 Military analysts and military specialists analyzing Colombian FARC guerrillas say the rebels have plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking and have no interest in old Belgian rifles or Chavez's assistance.
 A study published in 2003 by the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) reported that more than half of the weapons seized by Colombian guerrillas from the foreign military in 1998-2001 had originated from Venezuela.
 The implication is that corrupt or sympathetic members of the Venezuelan military may be aiding the guerrillas.
 The ideological and ideological training of military and new civilian reservists that Chavez has in mind may be more distressful for Chavez's domestic opponents.
 Earlier in 2005 Chavez called for the so-called revolutionary units to start preparing the public to resist superpower aggressors and said the first step in this process would be training 100,000 to 200,000 volunteers to back up active duty armed forces in the coming years.
 Military analysts estimate that Venezuela's active-duty armed forces number 83,000.
 People's defense units were created in neighborhoods, state companies, and the Free University established under Chavez, and they report directly to the President.
 The government insists that the reserves will support the armed forces and not act as a fifth column against a possible coup against Chavez.
 Espinoza said reserves should not be used for troops that shock any political party and that in a civil war each person decides which side to take.
 General Julio Ramon Quintero Viloria is the reserve commander.
 Quintero said in an interview that the armed forces hope to train 50,000 civilians per weekend in the second half of 2005, and could train 300,000 more in 2006.
 Quintero said the Venezuelan people do not want to be a colony of any empire and must be ready for any empire.
 200,000 reservists and the Venezuelan navy engaged in massive war games in June 2005 to repel a stronger invading country.
 40 employees of state oil companies participated in a similar exercise with 1,200 soldiers in June 2005.
 The pro-Chavista circles here have warned of symmetrical warfare.
 <b> asymmetric warfare</b> is a term coined by US military strategists that describes conflicts between unequal combatants in which the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics.
 The US government has given Colombia 3.3 billion dollars in military aid over the past five years, mostly military.
 Chavez loyalists fear that the US government could instigate a proxy war between Colombia and Venezuela as a way to oust Chavez and control oil from Venezuela.
 In an interview, a senior US official dismissed the notion that the U.S. government wants to invade Venezuela as completely and utterly nonsensical.
 The official said the Chavez side wishes to make a negative relationship happen because it is a political calculation that Mr. Chavez will reach power by constantly confronting the US.
 Another development troubling the United States is Chavez's rollback of military cooperation and joint exercises.
 The US military has had a Cooperation Office in a Venezuelan fort for 50 years.
 Chavez shut it down in 2004.
 5 US military trainers and students participating in exchange programs were ordered to leave the country in April 2005.
 Analysts said Chavez is likely to try to indoctrinate his public and his armed forces.
 Analysts say Chavez has not proven that he will use those forces to aid leftist revolutions elsewhere.

 The North Korean government may be preparing to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor in June 2007 in the first step to disable the reactor by December 2007.
 Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill stated on 18 June 2007 that the North Korean government may be prepared to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor in June 2007 as the first step to disable the reactor by December 2007.
 Hill is the United States head of negotiations on North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
 Hill stated that stalled efforts to dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons program could move ahead after the weekend of 16 June 2007 to 17 June 2007 when International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors will visit Pyongyang at the invitation of Pyongyang for talks on verifying and monitoring the shut down.
 Hill stated following talks with Chinese negotiator Wu Dawei that the shutdown would be anticipated for a long time.
 Hill stated that it is possible to shut down in the weeks to come but it is impossible to shut down in the months to come.
 The Associated Press reported from Vienna, Austria that the IAEA stated on 18 June 2007 that a team would visit Pyongyang the week of 24 June 2007 to discuss the manner in which inspectors would verify the shut-down.
 Hill stated that IAEA inspectors will hold talks with Pyongyang officials on sealing the reactor including installing television monitors at the site.
 North Korean officials refused to proceed with the agreement to begin decommissioning the Yongbyon reactor in February 2007 until 25 million dollars worth of funds in a linked North Korean account held in a Macao bank had been transferred to North Korea.
 The money was frozen as American officials accused Banco Delta Asia of complicity in financial crimes on behalf of North Korea.
 The funds were wired to the New York Federal Reserve Bank on June 14, 2007 after months of disagreement over the method of returning the funds.
 The funds are supposed to be sent to Russia's Central Bank before being transferred to accounts controlled by the North Korean government at Russian commercial banks.
 Hill stated that there will be talks the week of 17 June 2007 between disarmament negotiators from Russia, South Korea and Japan on steps to recoup some of the time lost in organizing the financial transfer.
 The discussions will also involve setting a timetable for the resumption of talks between the 6 nations on arms control.
 Under the agreement reached in February 2007 North Korean officials pledged to shut down the Yongbyon reactor and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown in return for a shipment of 50,000 tons of fuel oil.
 During the next phase of the agreement North Korean officials will declare all nuclear programs and disable all facilities in return for a further 950000 tons of fuel oil.
 Hill stated that the next phase of the agreement could technically conclude by December 2007.

 A leading arms control expert criticized the new plan for nuclear activities released by Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of the U.N. as ineffective and dangerous.
 On 27 August 2007 Iran and the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released a plan to resolve the issue by December 2007.
 The issue has been unresolved for four years.
 The plan is meant to allay suspicions about Iran's past nuclear activities.
 An agency official stated that the plan was a breakthrough.
 Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stated at a news conference in Tehran on 28 August 2007 --
 The investigation into Iran's nuclear activities is now closed.
 None of the other members of the International Atomic Energy Agency are cooperating as well as Iran is.
 Iran is a nuclear nation.
 Iran has a nuclear fuel cycle.
 Iran will not succumb to international pressure to curb its nuclear project.
 Iran's nuclear project is for peaceful purposes.
 The United States and some European nations believe Iran's nuclear project is to make nuclear weapons.
 Several Western governments and leading arms control experts stated that Iran is attempting to avoid further punishment by the U.N. Security Council.
 Western Governments include the United States and France.
 Government and experts believe Iran made the attempt.
 The arms control process is slow.
 The answer to questions about Iran's past violations of the treaty is inevitable.
 physicist and president of the Institute for Science and International Security David Albright stated --
 The Iranian claim has not been verified.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency has no access to people, documents and sites.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency will lose the right to any further future questions.
 An unusual development would set a bad precedent.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency may have been duped as it was eager for a deal.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency plan was announced.
 Iran resolved the question of its past plutonium experiments without explaining how.
 Senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies Mark Fitzpatrick stated --
 The International Atomic Energy Agency plan is superficial.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency plan has drawn out negotiations for many months.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency's plans could leave Iran with an incomplete and misleading answer.
 The International Institute for Strategic Studies is located in London.
 Plutonium is a material that can be used to make nuclear weapons.
 The Institute for Science and International Security is a private research organization located in Washington.

 A list from the Nuclear Suppliers Group shows that Iran has been denied approximately 75 times since 1998 to purchase nuclear-related materials on suspicion that the materials could be used to build a bomb.
 A list from the Nuclear Suppliers Group shows that Iran has been denied approximately 75 times since 1998 to purchase nuclear-related materials on suspicion that the materials could be used to build a bomb.
 The 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group is an offshoot of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and is charged with monitoring international trade to ensure that nuclear technology transferred for peaceful purposes is not directed for military use.
 The Nuclear Suppliers Group is composed of technologically advanced countries.
 The Nuclear Suppliers Group mission mission mission statement said countries would act on an individual basis to block trade in violation of export controls devised to maintain international cooperation in peaceful nuclear energy use.
 The Nuclear Suppliers Group has no enforcement power beyond to notify companies that they are violating its guidelines.
 The Nuclear Suppliers Group keeps the data private and meets in large secret.
 Most of the purchases have been denied since 2002 and have resulted in intervention by Nuclear Suppliers Group members.
 Diplomats from countries interested in exposing the extent of Iran's efforts to acquire so-called dual use items that could be converted to weapons production have been apprently added to the list of countries denying trade.
 The list is availble to the list under conditions that the diplomats and the countries from which they are from are not identified.
 The list named companies from Australia, Finland, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, and Iran as companies prevented from carrying out the deal because the sale items were suspected of being of military usefulness.
 The list of items offered for sale as part of the blocked deal includes nickel powder, petrochemical plant components, compressors, compressors, furnaces, steel flanges and fitting, electron microscopes, radiometric ore sorting machines, valves and tubes, lasers, rotating drilling rigs, mass spectrometers, and nitrogen production plants.
 Iranian end-use organizations include Iran's government and its Atomic Energy Organization, power and engineering companies, petrochemical and oil refineries, gas companies, the aircraft industry, schools, universities, engine manufacturers, mineral research centers, helicopter support companies and plasma physics centers.
 Diplomats stated that the 75 denials represented only the actions of 7 of the 45 member states.
 Diplomats stated that the actual number of denied sales of dual use products to Iran is probably much higher at 75.
 Western diplomats stated that as the standoff with Iran continues over Iran's nuclear program the government in Tehran is unwittingly using front companies to receive and convert technology for weapons production.
 Iran has signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty but is not a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.

 The Iranian Fars news agency stated that the hackers known as the XP group have defaced or blocked hundreds of Shiite-related websites.
 The official website of Iraq's Shiite leader Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani was one of the blocked websites that was defaced and blocked.
 On the defaced website the group XP stated that any website containing material contrary to Sunni teachings is being hacked.
 Iraqi religious leader Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani's official website has been defaced and blocked in a sectarian- motivated cyber attack on a Shiite-related site.
 It was unclear whether the attacks began on September 18, 2008 or the morning of 19 September 2008.
 On 19 September 2008 Al-Sistani's website was down on the evening of 19 September 2008.
 Another website related to one of Al-Sistani's religious organizations, www.al-shia.com, was also affected.
 An alternative address, www.sistani.com, is still in operation.
 The Iranian Fars news agency stated that the XP group blocked access to approximately 300 Shiite-related sites on September 18 and 19, 2008.
 The hacking claim and Iran's assertion that the XP group is based in the United Arab Emirates cannot be independently verified.
 Several Iranian news sites stated on September 19, 2008 that many of the Shiite and Iranian-related web sites that were attacked were running normally again.
 The statement signed by the XP group was posted on the home page of Al-Sistani's web site and stated that the attacks were carried out on behalf of Sunni Muslims.
 According to the statement:
 XP has carried out similar attacks on other Shiite sites in the Persian Gulf and Iraq.
 The XP group erased the sites as they have done with other Rafidha sites.
 Rafidha means reject and is an insult used by Sunni extremists to describe Shiites.
 Al-Sistani promoted sexual deviance and the Iranian agenda in Iraq as he was born in Iran.
 Any website with material contrary to Sunni teachings will be punished.
 The statement also consists of a video clip from the American comedian Bill Maher's YouTube clip which ridicules Al-Sistani's fatwa on whether married couples may be permitted certain positions of sexual intercourse.
 The office of the Ayatollah in Najaf declined to comment on the cyber attacks.
 The Fars reported that the counter-attacks were carried out against two major Wahhabist web sites belonging to the puritanical strain of Sunni Islam that is dominant in Saudi Arabia.

 The Somali pirates who hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms were approaching a deal to release the ship.
 Questions have emerged regarding arms shipments via the route to Kenya and possible clandestine deals between Kenya and South Sudan.
 Maritime officials and associates of Somali pirates who hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms stated on October 8, 2008 that the pirates may soon collect a ransom for the Ukrainian freighter which was hijacked on September 25, 2008.
 After difficult negotiations that several people involved in the bazaar-style haggling likened to haggling, the parties came close to reaching a deal to pay the pirates millions of dollars and free the ship.
 Ahmed Omar in Xarardheere, Somalia stated that the pirates agreed to a ransom of approximately 8 million U.S. dollars from the ship's owners and that the ship could be freed on October 8 or 9, 2008.
 Xarardheere is a notorious pirate base on the Somali coast.
 Maritime officials in Kenya stated that critical details have yet to be agreed upon.
 One such detail involves a pirate's request for guarantees that the armada of American warships currently encircling the pirates will not arrest or attack them.
 An anonymous Kenyan maritime official stated that such negotiations are complex and involve more than financial aspects.
 Officials stated on October 8, 2008 that there was progress and that the parties would approach an agreement.
 The pirates initially requested 35 million U.S. dollars and then reduced it to 20 million U.S. dollars.
 The pirates have consistently expressed willingness to negotiate financial figures.
 More than 25 ships have been hijacked off the Somali coast in 2008 for ransom typically for between 1 and 2 million U.S. dollars.
 The pirates on board the Ukrainian ship stated that the ship, its cargo and the 20 sailors on board would be released once the pirates were received payment of 100 U.S. dollars and a 100 dollar bill.
 The question is who was the original destination of the arms shipment that was on board the Ukrainian ship.
 The Kenyan government claimed the weapons on board were shipped to Kenya's military shortly after the freighter was hijacked on 25 September 2008.
 The ship was on the route to Kenya's main port of Mombasa.
 The weapons on board the ship included 33 T-72 tanks, 150 grenade launchers, 6 anti-aircraft guns and large quantities of ammunition.
 Evidence subsequently emerged that the weapons were part of a clandestine arms deal between Kenya and the separatist region of southern Sudan.
 The deal is most likely to remain secret unless the pirates don't hijack a ship and begin speaking to the media through satellite phones.
 Ukrainian officials have been adamant in denying any wrongdoing.
 Ukrainian diplomat in Kenya Oleh Belokolos stated --
 Ukraine has not supplied any armaments to the Government of South Sudan or has any plans to do so.
 All appropriate paperwork was validated.
 Ukraine will abide by all United Nations rules and arms control agreements.
 Ukraine inherited an enormous weaponry stockpile after the collapse of the Soviet Union and is now in a major arms deal.
 Kenya's deal with Ukraine is considered suspicious because Kenya mostly relies on the United Kingdom and other Western countries for heavy weapons supplies.
 Kenyan politicians demanded answers and called for several commissions to be set up to examine the situation.
 Southern Sudan is an autonomous region that currently increases its military and uses Soviet-designed tanks.
 The United States military stated that it is a priority for the United States military to ensure that the ship does not unload weapons and that the weapons are not sold to Islamic insurgents in Somalia.
 The pirates denied any interest in weapons and claimed they were unaware that the cargo included tanks when they hijacked the ship.
 pirate spokesman Sugule Ali stated in an interview last week that the pirates' sole interest in the deal was money.

 Head of the U.N. Drug Office Antonio Maria Costa said Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban have cut back on poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in an effort to support the price and preserve a major source of funding for the insurgency.
 Head of the U.N. Drug Office Antonio Maria Costa said Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban have cut back on poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in an effort to support the price and preserve a major source of funding for the insurgency.
 Costa said this to reporters last week as the U.N. Drug Office prepared to release its latest survey of Afghanistan's opium crop.
 The survey showed that poppy cultivation has retreated in much of Afghanistan and poppy cultivation is overwhelmingly concentrated in 7 of the 34 provinces where the insurgency remains strong, mostly in the south.
 The survey was issued on November 27, 2008.
 The United Nations found that the result was a 19 percent reduction in the amount of land devoted to opium in Afghanistan despite a drop of just 6 percent in total opium production tonnage.
 The study stated that high output per acre is attributed to a good southern growing season.
 The southern region is a heavily irrigated area where the Taliban maintain a strong presence in the 5 provinces and have systematically encouraged opium cultivation to finance their insurgency for several years.
 The U.N. estimates that insurgents made much of the $300 million in the opium trade last year.
 Costa said a lot of the war effort could be funded by $2 billion to $3 billion.
 The Taliban have produced an amount of opium far exceeding world demand after three successive years of bumper crops.
 Costa said the results would be a glut that would depress prices, which would drop approximately 20 percent.
 Costa said there is evidence that the Taliban, drug lords and even some farmers are stockpiling opium because prices have not already collapsed.
 The increased amount is also being processed in Afghanistan.
 Costa added that the insurgents held a significant amount of opium.
 Costa said there was a surplus of as much as 11,000 tons (more than twice the world's demand over the past three years) and threatened that the surplus would devalue their stockpile.
 The United Nations found Afghanistan produced 8500 tons of opium in 2008.
 The world demand is estimated at about 440,000 tons per year.
 The Taliban have taken a passive stance against cultivation this year and are putting less pressure on Afghan farmers to plant opium poppies.
 Then this supports the current prices.
 Costa is an Italian diplomat who served for 6 years in the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime.

 The Citizen newspaper stated on 6 October 2001 that it is illegal for South Africans to be involved in mercenary activities or to render assistance to the foreign military inside or outside South Africa.
 The Citizen newspaper stated that on 5 October 2001 the South African Foreign Ministry announced that the South African government will impose a ban on mercenary activities following reports that 1,000 Muslim military training personnel have enlisted to leave South Africa for Afghanistan to fight for the Taliban against the United States.
 The report claimed that 1,000 military-trained Muslim men volunteered for their service and received backing from local businessmen under the name Muslims Against Illegitimate Leaders.
 The report claimed that all 1,000 Muslim men trained in military training were over the age of 18.
 <b>Muslims Against Illegitimate Leaders</b> is a Cape Town-based group.
 The Muslim Judicial Council refuted the report.
 South Africa's Foreign Ministry stated that South Africa's Foreign Military Assistance Act prohibits the recruitment of people from inside or outside South Africa as mercenaries or foreign military assistance.
 South Africa's Foreign Military Assistance Act means that people will not be allowed to offer military assistance to any state, organ or group, or other country unless the National Conventional Arms Control Committee grants permission.
 South Africa's Foreign Military Assistance Act means that foreign military assistance can be rendered only in accordance with agreements approved by the National Conventional Arms Control Committee.

 Montesinos was sentenced to 9 years and 4 months in prison on the conviction.
 Montesinos plans to appeal the sentence.
 Former Peruvian spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos was convicted on July 1, 2002 of illegally taking control of the National Intelligence Service while only supposed to be an advisor to the spy agency.
 Montesinos was sentenced to 9 years and 4 months in prison for abuse of authority.
 The sentence also ordered Montesinos to pay 3 million dollars in state compensation.
 Anti-corruption judge Saul Pena stated that Montesinos admitted to the charges of abuse of authority.
 This is the first ruling in more than 50 charges against Montesinos including corruption, drug trafficking, dealing in illegal arms and human rights violations.
 Montesinos is alleged to have run a network of bribes.
 A leaked videotape showed Montesinos bribing a congressman to switch to the government party and triggered events that culminated in Fujimori's resignation in November 2000.
 Fujimori has been accused of dereliction of duty and embezzlement and has been in exile in Japan since his resignation to avoid legal action by Peruvian authorities under the protection of dual nationality.
 Montesinos fled Peru in October 2000 but was captured on June 23, 2001 in Venezuela.
 Montesinos heard the sentences at the port of Callao Naval Base where he has been imprisoned since 2001.
 Montesinos stated that he will consult with defense lawyers regarding his appeal.

 Hong Kong police are trying to prevent Triad or transnational criminal syndicates from engaging in criminal activities.
 Hong Kong police recently smashed transnational theft syndicates specializing in exploiting youngsters to commit various crimes, cross-border criminal syndicates and local triad gangs.
 According to the Oriental Daily News , Hong Kong police 's recent efforts to cut down five of the so-called leaders of the so-called triad branch or so-called district team leaders within a short period of time demonstrated that Hong Kong police are determined to eradicate criminal activities .
 Hong Kong police recently worked closely with the Public Security Bureau of Guangdong province for intelligence exchange and carried out a series of raids and operations in the series.
 Hong Kong police cracked down on triad activities from 18 July 2002 to 24 July 2002 including drug trafficking, illegal possession of arms, theft, burglary, robbery, sales of pirate records and obscene material, cigarettes and duty-free cigarettes and trafficking of dangerous drugs.
 On 24 July 2002 police were reported to have dispatched over 100 staff to storm a propitiated dance and wine party organized at a disco nightclub in Mongkok, Kowloon to settle some disputes between 2 Triad groups.
 Police eventually arrested 3 branch leaders and 14 core members of the triad.
 Police sources confirmed to the Xinhua News Agency on 25 July 2002 that all 17 arrested people were still being detained for questioning.
 The Hong Kong police source was quoted as saying that the operation succeeded in netting all 17 people as a result of efforts by Hong Kong police to infiltrate relevant gangs here .
 Police sources also intimated that more crackdowns by Hong Kong police would follow on other Triad gangs.
 Hong Kong police are involved in active cooperation with police on the Chinese mainland and in other regions in their efforts to fight off criminal organizers.
 The first so-called target conference of the International Drug Enforcement Conference in the Far East was held in Hong Kong earlier in July 2002.
 Hong Kong was chosen to host the event following a decision made by IDEC at a meeting held in Bolivia in February 2002.
 Some 42 senior anti-narcotics officers from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Australia, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and the United States met.
 A Hong Kong police internal news letter recently reported that the aim of the conference is to provide a flexible and forward thinking environment for information sharing and positive action to counter criminal transnational drug traffickers' organized crime.
 The exchange of intelligence between Hong Kong police and Chinese mainland police is particularly intense.
 A delegation of 11 members of mainland China 's National Narcotics Control Commission recently visited Hong Kong to study how police here enforce their anti-narcotics laws .
 The team , consisting of 11 people , was chaired by Chen Cunyi , deputy director of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security 's Bureau of Narcotics Control , and was briefed by Hong Kong police on the enforcement actions carried out in Hong Kong , and led by the head of Hong Kong 's Narcotics Bureau , Ip Lau Chuen .
 Hong Kong police also exchanged mutual concerns with China 's National Narcotics Control Commission and discussed a number of issues , including anti-drug trafficking and money-laundering activities , and discussed a number of issues .
 The mainland parties closed their visit after meeting with Hong Kong Deputy Assistant Commissioner of Crime Yam Tat Wing and discussed further cooperation in combating cross-border drug trafficking activities .

 A Peruvian military document disclosed that Montesinos, a former head of intelligence, was linked to drug trafficking.
 The documents signed by a high-ranking former Peruvian army officer and disclosed on 25 July 2002 mention drug trafficking links and could further compromise the situation of Vladimiro Montesinos, the former head of Peru's National Intelligence Service.
 According to a front page story in Peru's national daily El Comercio, Montesinos may have authorized military leaders in the Alto Huallaga region to deal with the drug in order to find leaders of the rebel Shinning Path and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.
 Alto Huallaga is located northeast of the capital Lima.
 The story is based on a final report by the Attorney General's Office.
 The Attorney General's Office report was collected from accusations documents handed over by an unnamed Peruvian army general.
 El Comercio said the Scorpion intelligence operation was put into effect in 1992 by the then-president Alberto Fujimori's government to fight terrorism and drug trafficking in the Amazon region.
 Several agents infiltrated the group as part of the planned "Scorpion" event to gather information on the main rebels and drug traffickers' commanders.
 An additional order was also ordered for the transport of cocaine to cover up the agents.
 Montesinos is a close advisor to former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori.
 Fujimori resigned in November over the bribery scandal and is now in prison in Lima for alleged connections to the scandal.

 Anti-government insurgents in Nepal have escalated bombings and murders following the end of a state of emergency.
 Insurgents plan attacks during mid-term parliamentary elections.
 A 9-month-long nationwide state of emergency in Nepal expired on August 28, 2002.
 Violence committed by anti-government insurgents has escalated across Nepal and bomb threats and explosions have occurred throughout the country.
 At least 5 major bomb incidents occurred in the Kathmandu Valley between 28 August 2002 and 4 September 2002.
 On 28 August 2002 a bomb exploded in a supermarket in central Kathmandu city injuring 2 people.
 On 29 August 2002 1 soldier was killed by a bomb in the Lalitpur district of the Kathmandu Valley.
 Later on 29 August 2002 2 separate bomb incidents occurred in the municipality of Lalitpur and a shop in Kathmandu.
 On 4 September 2002 a bomb exploded at a Kathmandu metropolis office.
 Outside the Kathmandu Valley, anti-government guerrillas murdered many activists from the ruling Nepali Congress party and other parties and burned or bombed several buildings.
 Underground insurgent leaders stated in an interview with the English-language daily The Kathmandu Post that insurgents will disrupt mid-term parliamentary elections on 13 November 2002 comprehensively and violently.
 On 29 August 2002 the British embassy in Nepal warned British nationals against an increasing anti-government offensive and advised them to avoid areas cordoned off by Nepalese security personnel.
 The embassy stated that intelligence assessments suggest that anti-government guerrillas may be preparing a campaign to complement their country activities in the city.
 The US State Department stated that after the recent bombings the risk to US citizens and interests is heightened particularly outside the Kathmandu Valley because of anti-government insurgents in Nepal.
 The US State Department stated publicly on September 3, 2002 that anti-government insurgents plan new violence before a general strike declared for September 16, 2002.
 The Nepal government is considering reimposing a state of emergency to maintain law and order.
 Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba stated that Prime Minister Deuba will consult with concerned people and parties over the possibility of extending the state of emergency.
 Deuba aborted a planned trip to Johannesburg for the World Summit on Sustainable Development and immediately returned to Nepal after a 9-day visit to Europe due to tensions.
 The Nepalese government imposed a state of emergency on November 26, 2001 when anti-government guerrillas unilaterally defied a 4-month-long cease-fire negotiations with the government and attacked army barracks and police posts.

 Several policemen have been killed and wounded by guerrillas in Nepal following the breakdown of peace talks between the guerrillas and the Nepalese government.
 State-run Radio Nepal reported on 20 October 2002 that at least 3 policemen were killed and 19 others wounded when their vehicle was ambushed by anti-government guerrillas in western Nepal on the evening of 19 October 2002.
 Radio Nepal quoted security officials as stating that --
 Three police personnel including an inspector and a sub-inspector were killed when two police vehicles moved into the Tikapur area of Kailali district to search for the guerrillas.
 All the policemen killed and wounded were in the first vehicle.
 A vehicle driver was also killed in the ambush.
 Five police personnel are still missing.
 wounded police personnel were brought to Kathmandu and Nepalgunj for treatment and additional security personnel were mobilized in the area to defend against the guerrillas.
 Anti-government insurgents have increased violent activities across the Himalayan kingdom since a 9-month-long nationwide state of emergency expired at the end of August 2002.
 The Government of Nepal initiated peace talks with the guerrillas in August 2001 to find a peaceful solution to the guerrilla insurgency which has killed more than 5,000 people including policemen, members of the guerrillas and civilians since it began in the Himalayan kingdom in 1996.
 The three rounds of talks held have not concluded due to the guerrillas' demands for the establishment of a republic in the republic, an interim government and a new constitution which the Nepalese government rejects.
 More than 3700 guerrillas and hundreds of security personnel have been killed since the Nepalese government imposed a state of emergency on November 26, 2001 following a series of attacks on Nepalese security forces after the guerrillas on November 23, 2001 broke the 4-month-long cease-fire talks with the government.
