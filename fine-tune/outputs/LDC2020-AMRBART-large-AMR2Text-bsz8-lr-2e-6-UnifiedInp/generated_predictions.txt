 Resolutely support the person who started the thread, I replied with a poem I composed myself.
 Pledge to fight to the death to defend the Diaoyu Islands and the related islands.
 A fishing boat bumped into the fleet. Again, with a thief's heart and a form of arrogance, they showed their wolfish appearance. The evil little Japanese ghosts stirred up unrest and caused trouble.
 Never go back to that time when we made a humiliating appearance when we signed the treaty! China is strong! Sword and knife are sharp and shining! Let's bury the approaching enemy!
 September 11, 2010
 I agree with the analysis of the thread starter. If war really comes, I would like to be Hua Mulan to protect our home, defend our homeland, spread the prestige of our country, and pledge to fight to the death for the defense of our national dignity. Bump up resolutely!
 I very much wish I had been born during Mao Zedong's passionate and upsurge Long March, to lose my head, to shed my blood, to completely extinguish all the wrongdoers and enemies of China, and to spread our dragon prestige.
 How long did we tolerate Japan?
 I say to my fellow citizens...
 Hello everyone! We all know about the September 18th incident, but now again, as we all know, Japan has premeditated and premeditated another incident at sea, like the Lugou Bridge incident.
 Japan surprisingly defied the whole world 's strong condemnation and openly invaded our country 's sacred territory , the Diaoyu Islands .
 As we all know, the Diaoyu Islands have always belonged to China. For historical reasons, what we originally belonged to has become a controversy.
 I asked my fellow citizens what our things were and why was there a need for negotiations? So Japan went even further, they wanted to create the fact of occupation, could we allow this? Absolutely not!
 My fellow citizens, Japan's militarism brought grave disaster to the Asian people.
 Especially China, which suffered from Japanese ravages for a long period of several decades.
 In Northeast China , Japanese Unit 731 cruelly experimented with extremely brutal methods of human body experimentation on Chinese, Korean and other country's living people with extremely brutal methods in the Northeast . The Nanjing Massacre added an layer of blood that would never fade away to the ancient capital . The big bloody battles in Hengyang and Changsha bare the bones of the dead for over 1,000 kilometers (620 miles ) and killed off everything .
 When it comes to the heinous crimes committed by Japan in China, my fellow citizens, there are too many instances that are difficult to record and cannot be cited without all the bamboo strips being exhausted.
 Just like those 10 million deceased souls who lost their lives wandered over the Pacific Ocean and found it difficult to rest in peace.
 Therefore, all those who experienced that era still remember it vivid. At any time when we turn to this page of history and read it, even our younger generation also cried with tears streaming down our cheeks and our blood boiled with indignation.
 Now that Japan actually wants to reverse the verdict of the history of its aggression, it has woke up fellow citizens and Chinese people in Asia.
 Although the issues of history are not resolved, it is painful for us to go back and look back at these shameful 100 years, we have to go on facing them, create and choose history.
 It is by responsibility that we are not afraid. Though the territory is small, it is a matter of dignity. The interests of the country and the unity of the nation guarantee honor no matter how the wind and clouds change. We can not let our native land be separated even though it is scarred and wounded.
 My fellow citizens , the advent of the 21st century means that the Chinese nation is a nation beset by difficulties on the inside , but pressed from the outside , and we face many challenges .
 How should we go about the Taiwan issue, the Tibet issue, the South China Sea issue, the surrounding environment, or the aggressive foreign forces against China?
 What do I ask my fellow citizens? Please look at the world map, the crescent-shaped encirclement is suppressing our breath, strangling our development and coveting our national territory.
 We didn't want to make enemies, but we didn't want to make enemies either. We didn't want war, but we weren't afraid of war. We were never afraid of the enemy.
 We must urgently arrange arms and strengthen all military forces on land, sea and air.
 The Chinese nation has flourished for several thousand years, but it has never before had the ambition to expand its territory outward.
 We follow a strategic and foreign security philosophy that applies benevolence and virtue, not wanting to impose our wants on others.
 It's like a country being tolerant and liberal is like an individual being tolerant and liberal - we have to insist on not hurting others, but to avoid hurting others.
 Tolerance is certainly not fear, and sincerity does not have to be cowardice.
 Exempting Japan from war repairs caused by World War II by China will serve as a service of benevolence to peace .
 My fellow citizens , the People 's Heroes Monument is a condense history of a Chinese nation striving for continuous improvement .
 The magnificent solemn posture represented a sacred expectation of peace.
 From time to time, thoughts of the many heroic and tragic heroic scenes of shining spears and armored horses that have stirred up a string of memories agitate my memory.
 My thoughts went through those yellowed pages of history as I saw Kangxi, a famous generation-old Emperor who had contemplated alone in his audience hall hundreds of years ago how to achieve the unification of the territories, and also Abraham Lincoln, a former U.S. president who wandered alone in the dark of the great hall, thinking about the integrity of the Union.
 To forget about war is certainly dangerous, but it is a dangerous thing to forget about peace in the world. My fellow citizens, if we want development and peace, we must never exercise forbearance blindly, but the Boxer Protocol of betrayal and humiliation of the nation aggravated China's poverty and backwardness in modern times. Falling behind leads to bullying.
 Without strength , where will the peace come from ?
 We must focus on national defense education, build a great wall of trust in the hearts of 1.3 billion people, and establish a full-range system of defense that is capable of attacking and defending the nation.
 The best defense is attack defense. On the premise of avoiding influences on national economic development, we should strengthen the force that can engage in ultra-long-range attacks, improve combat capabilities at all levels of aerospace, and improve combat capabilities at great distances and depths. Increase defense industry investment and construction , accelerate the modernization and internationalization of military equipment , and establish elite high-quality high-tech divisions , on the premise of avoiding influence on national economic development .
 The battle horns are about to sound, the people are already fully equipped and ready to go.
 We have accomplished nothing without the support of the people, but we are all powerful with the support of the people.
 It's time for us to say no to other people, my fellow citizens, it's time for us to say no to other people, that's what we have to achieve.
 1. Establishing guaranteed funds , improving the work environment and work mechanism , and recruiting back to China the hundreds of thousands of professionals who have emigrated from the United States and around the world to the United States and linger in the United States with their knowledge of information technology .
 2) Create a few battle groups of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.
 3,000 advanced combat aircraft of various kinds of various kinds will be manufactured.
 4. Advancing research and deployment of high-speed, intercontinental ballistic missiles with a range of more than 10,000 nautical miles and a range that could break missile defense systems in the world.
 5. Resumption of nuclear experimentation and establishment of military forces in space.
 6. retain 1000 nuclear bombs equal to 1 million tons of TNT and install nuclear warheads on all short and middle-range missiles when necessary.
 7. The retention of 30 strategic nuclear submarines with the ability to inflict 3 devastating nuclear strikes on an enemy.
 8. Abolish your commitment to not using nuclear weapons first.
 9. The right to pre-emptive strike is retained in the event of a threat to national security.
 My fellow citizens! Qin Shi Huang unified China! Zheng Chenggong recovered Taiwan! We must carry on carrying on the far - seeing, insight and strong will of our predecessors! It is our responsibility! Only with confidence and improvement can we strive to be strong!
 Now, those pieces of land that tremble far away from the embrace of the motherland are shaking, moaning and calling. Fellow citizens, let us carry forward, courageously moving forward, carrying forward the unfinished wishes of the previous generals!
 When I read the history, the heaviness and anger in my heart simmered as I read the history, causing concern to the nation. Having been born to a cloth gown, and being one of the common people, though I am a common person, I am willing to voluntarily serve our country in order for the prosperity and splendidness of the motherland, and even if I die, I will not regret it. To show my sincere and patriotic heart to heaven is adequate.
 Here I compose poems in the classical form of Ci to voice the aspirations of my heart .
 Paint a deep red lip.
 Protect the Diaoyu Islands!
 We bitterly lost our Ryukyu Islands.
 How can we allow the Diaoyu Islands to fall to other countries?
 100 years of vicissitude.
 Smoke and clouds chased the flying waves.
 The youngest brother is still a tender-hearted youth.
 It wandered off in all directions , bearing a seal .
 Look over at the flag.
 We brandished our weapons and crossed to the east.
 Let the horses drink from the Pacific Ocean.

 The other article is titled "My dream book for Taiwanese compatriots: I have a dream; a memorial museum or temple needs to be built for Chinese national heroes; how long will we tolerate it, how long will China ever beg for the Olympics if the country expects it; if we forget the hardship of history, there will be more history of hardship if we forget the hardship of history; I am a Chinese person, China is only one nation and one culture; the state can decline when sport over develops; the wealthy and the strong, the rich and the poor, the rich and the poor, we need a high-level entertainment star and technological talent; the filthy Ren Zhiqiang shut his filthy mouth, the hateful housing prices, the garbage-garbage Li Yinhe, the garbage-garbage Li Yinhe, according to Google, has no right to make irresponsible remarks about the US, how long will we tolerate the US if we tolerate the US? My brother and sister are strong, my brother and sister are strong, the strong person Ban Ki-moon, the strong anti-bomber Ban Ki-moon, is a strong anti-bomber in Hiroshima, how long will we tolerate the US? "
 Why didn't we fight the little Japan?
 What are the Chinese still going to tolerate?
 They even ride on our heads.
 Still do the gutless Chinese do this?
 We should tell the whole world that others cannot bully China at will.
 It is time for us to show our strength. China has been calm for too long.
 Currently, our citizens' lives are all too carefree, the officials are too extravagant.
 We already have no cohesion now. China needs to start a war. It will be a harsh slap in the face to countries that follow the rear of the United States.
 Let them know that the US is not a panacea; if we win, we can increase the influence of China; if we lose, we can clean out the incompetent bureaucrats and make the trash get out; if we lose, let China have new blood and update; if we lose, let China get up.
 Go China!
 I suggest that China strengthen its guard of the Diaoyu Islands, guard the Diaoyu Islands daily, protect the fishermen and sovereignty of our country, and if Japan dare to invade our territory with military force, we will fight a small-scale war to defend ourselves, no matter what the cost. China cannot lose.
 We need shows in life, but it's really p. to show you how it is to be embraced by someone.
 I just passed by.
 The whole society, including the stars, is like this.
 Disgusting, Disgusting, Disgusting.
 It is totally unacceptable.
 Agreed, just a cheap entertainer, somewhat makes sense in feudal China, what they are reputed to be.
 Their lives look glorious.
 A group of 9 professions.
 Life is hard.
 Shocking.
 That's normal. And a whore is heartless, and a performer is not always righteous.
 They want the money, not the face.
 Look at the wolf near Ms. Fan, the one with the glasses, you know the actors have to drink with him, without being forced out or even framed.
 SOB.
 OK, as long as there is something to eat, loveliness to be had.
 No one is easy, life is like a show, you have to look at the script to know how the performance is going.
 All of them.
 In all 360 walks of life, there are people who top the Imperial Examination. How effort and endeavor are the people behind those who top the Imperial Examination. This humiliates the word " bean vermicelli".
 Hahahaha.
 Overdoing it.
 Reality.
 Shoot those hooligans.
 Cheers for the cheap performer.
 Cheers for the cheap performer.
 The entertainment circle is dirty. All the men in it are birds and beasts and scum.
 Pity them, but who to blame? Not easy to be a star female.
 Everybody does this, if you don't do this how can you make money?
 The woman is proud when she is in front of other people, but when she is alone she is in a melancholic mood.
 To put it plainly, nowadays's stars are just popular prostitutes, just like in ancient times; they are now famous prostitutes, so it is normal for them to just drink with or even sleep with some high officials.
 Stop talking to other people, just behave yourself.
 What should we do in future? Are we too faced with such hard choices too? Our capabilities alone are not enough to succeed?
 More suffering, more suffering disguised as a glorious look, is indisputible.
 It's not so bad because they just play in their own circles, without keeping things in mind if they don't see what's happening, it's not so bad.
 But there is an old guy, Zhang Jizhong, an old guy who has been behaving like a hooligan in his own circle, and also thinks himself to be virtuous without any talent. When he has nothing to do, he makes television series when he has nothing to do, wrecking the whole country.
 Both take what they need.
 When was China able to have pure and innocent girls?
 The story is now very shocking in the world of entertainment. There are rumors that Hsu Yuki was forced out because he refused to drink with the guests as arranged by the company, and had to switch to working as a lawyer's assistant instead to make the meeting of the end meet.
 The much envied and star-crossed superpowers often encounter social engagements or circumstances that they don't welcome but have to join in.
 After all, they can't decide on many things, because it must have to do with many aspects and the interests of many people.
 Sometimes, as we ordinary people imagine, the very normal dinner parties that seem so normal to us ordinary people can not be that simple for the stars.
 The star has a lot of contracts and if she tackles well her sources of money will roll in. If she doesn't tack well her heels will come off if forced out or even framed.
 There are two kinds of smart female stars: those of the first kind always hold very high integrity and sternly reject all such invitations.
 The second kind of person is the one who is good at playing tricks and achieving their objectives with their own seed money.
 There are rumors that even some super-star female actors have won their first roles this way.
 After drinking some alcohol, advertisers or show sponsors may have a chance to lie on the star's shoulder, feel her chin, or kiss her cheek, and the attitude she most adopt is " endure."
 They are the very people who are in the lower 9 professions.
 Those stars are just pretending and actually living much better lives than this!
 Agreed, just a cheap entertainer, somewhat makes sense in feudal China, what they are reputed to be.
 Agreed.
 Oh well, actors aren't that easy.
 They deserve it, they asked for that.
 It dawned on me that nothing would be easy.
 Women are birds and beasts, and men are worse than birds and beasts.
 BRAWLING!
 BRAWLING!
 It won't take long.
 The circumference highway, Route 288, which runs around the southwestern quadrant of the Richmond New Urban Region, was opened in late 2004.
 It has already changed the development pattern by making it worse, and caused localised traffic congestion around its exits.
 The Richmond Times-Dispatch tells the tale of the impact of the Huguenot Trail in Powhatan County today.
 Will Jones reported traffic on one section of the Huguenot Trail has more than doubled since 288 opened.
 speeding and accidents have surged as well.
 So far this year, 17 accidents near the intersection of Winterfield Road have been reported, up from 12 in all of 2004.
 Dale Totten, a resident engineer with the Virginia Department of Transportation, noted that with more money, the agency would have four more road lanes at a cost of about $13 million.
 Of course, VDOT does not have the money to construct roads in the Richmond region.
 Because VDOT spent all their friggin' money on 288 because of local politicians and boosters.
 Where is Homer Simpson when you need him?
 This is a major moment, doh!
 As we predicted, Route 288 will generate residential development in all the scarce populated areas around its exit, overtaxing local roads throughout the country.
 Others chose where to work and live, while a limited-access highway could relieve traffic for drivers driving back and forth between Chesterfield County and Goochland County.
 And they create traffic congestion in new places.
 I am surprised that this is only rapid.
 Even I think 3 or 4 years could be lagging behind.
 Think of the liability that Route 288 would have created for all of its exits, just this one, since Route 288 already created 13 million dollars in road construction at just this one exit.
 Another prediction.
 After a few more years of scattered subdivision development and approval of a mega- commercial project at the intersection of 288 and a major road, the need for new road improvements soared.
 By the end of the decade, we could well see the unfunded liabilities zoom past the original $400 million it took to build the original highway.
 What a great idea Route 288 was, say the brainiacs who thought it was such a great idea.
 Thank you for nothing.
 I think we could have spent a good $400 million elsewhere.
 I don't think you should blame 288 for creating those people.
 If they are enough to create traffic congestion in new places in new places, what is the alternative?
 additional traffic congestion in the old place?
 Now you understand how people like TMT in Fairfax feel.
 I usually take a pro-road position.
 But 288 is a definite excess, with glaring needs in other parts of the state.
 Richmond has virtually no traffic.
 The rush hour hour was 30 minutes long.
 And you give them a beltway through a large rural area.
 Road to nowhere.
 Just think how much of this money could be spent on another Potomac crossing facility or road improvements that are desperately needed in NOVA.
 @Virginia Centrist, To add insult to injury, the rest of the state helped pay for 288 in last year's budget deal, so that will wipe out the debt, according to you.
 It's very nice of you all to oblige us.
 Not much sense, though.
 It's the same old problem.
 If you get ahead of the need, you get accused of causing the sprawl.
 It is claimed that if you build in a place where the needs are already acute, you cannot pave your way out of congestion.
 Anonymous.
 That's the fair point.
 5:26 is a good point.
 But this situation has hammered home the validity of a state audit report that found that the CTB and VDOT funded transportation projects based on the best interests of the best lobbyists rather than on a comprehensive transportation plan for the state.
 I submit this is a disgraceful situation that should not be tolerated.
 And to make this worse, Chichester and his toadies are pouring more money into these flawed institutions.
 What is the purpose of transportation expenses?
 In Virginia it was for the benefit of the private business plan and not in the service of the public interest.
 You all are dead wrong.
 No less Walter Stosch stated that 288 was intended to be paid for with economic development money.
 C'mon folks...
 I don't understand your point, TMT.
 When's the last time you were stuck in traffic not going or going to some sort of business?
 The whole point of the road seems to me to be to facilitate the public's interest in getting into and out of private businesses.
 Business support is overwhelmingly needed, even after a Sunday drive, a trip to the grandmother's location, and, of course, a soccer game.
 No wonder we suffer congestion problems, our road expenditures are not matching the increase in business or state GDP.
 If we recognize that the primary business benefit of the road is business, then we should do two things:
 Of course businesses will pay more for their own transportation bills (of course they will) and even if this means more travel overall, we encourage them to locate themselves where they are least stressful to the system.
 Why is it so hard to understand?
 Solving the functioning human settlement pattern and balancing the capacity of the transport system against the travel demand generated by the use of land will be the solution .
 All else is a lie.
 EMR
 TMT: In Virginia, it was for the benefit of the private business plan and not the public interest.
 I don't see the point of this statement, as it appears to demonize private business plans and put the public interest above all else.
 I think they are tightly intertwined so they are virtually the same person.
 It's obviously a local problem because these cookie doughs are lumpy.
 But in the aggregate, if we demonize business long enough, we will eventually find that all of us are working for the devil.
 I don't see the point of claiming a solution to a balance that has an ever changing dynamic nature.
 Even you would see the positives of rail to Dulles, it is a job center and would promote bidirectional demand for rail.
 I agree.
 In fact, that may be the reason it was built, all on its own may be sufficient reason to build it.
 All I'm saying is that the exact same logic should be applied to the road.
 They should have a destination on both ends so that we can use our investments to the maximum.
 In order to get closer to the balance you say we need, we need more places.
 Reality checks here.
 I drive past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.
 I commute back and forth to and from work on the Huguenot trail.
 I've never seen anything remotely like the traffic flooding.
 It's a 55 mph zone, how many cars do you see 75-100 every morning?
 The Huguenot Trail is already planned to be widened because of heavy demand from development on the Chesterfield side, new schools, and a whole bunch of existing development that was zoned and funneled through Robious Road years ago.
 288 would be wonderful for those of us who actually use it, rather than a bottleneck for Powhatan and west Chesterfield because of their lack of roads.
 We can develop commercial development and our work can be closer to our lives.
 You might think that is an irrational use of land.
 I have no desire to live in any city.
 I refuse to work in the downtown area.
 I refuse to use mass transit, which is unsafe for female commuters who work long, irregular hours.
 And I happen to like the development of large lots.
 I don't understand exactly how I'm supposed to keep a horse on a 1/4 acre lot.
 One gallon of gas can go for $10.
 And I still pay to live in the country.
 Many people have a legitimate preference for horses, hunting, gardens, and certain types of small businesses, which makes them not want to live in the urban core.
 I am truly baffled by this infatuation with living in the city.
 Anonymous 6:37 PM · You have every right to live in the country if you wish to.
 But you have no right to have the rest of the state underwrite the construction of a $400 million highway to make shopping and getting to work easier.
 In the 288 debate, anything else that could be spent $400 million has been consistently overlooked in the 288 debate.
 Much traffic congestion can be alleviated if the money is applied to other pressing road projects, or even (god forbid) non-roads projects.
 @Ray Hyde, My comments are directed at the investors who lobbied for the road to be placed near their property and the incompetent system that funded this request regardless of whether or not it was linked to the master transportation plan or not.
 I am 24, and I am a mother of 2.5 children.
 I've been breaking up with my son's father since August.
 I wanted to start dating other people, and my son's father said he would have nothing to do with it if I did.
 He is very possessive and controls, but because we are together he has no right to do that.
 There is too much going on in his life right now, and although I've told him several times that I don't love him and he doesn't love me, he thinks we can work together.
 I want him there for his son without needing me too.
 But he has no one, his family doesn't get along with him and he and his family have issues.
 I don't want to be miserable anymore and the longer he's around the more miserable I will be.
 I don't want him there for his son because he was a good father or at least tried to be.
 I believe every child needs both parents, whether they be together or not.
 But he thinks that if he can't have me, no one else can.
 What do I do with my life moving on?
 It's very bad that your ex would threaten you by using his son.
 You must not give in to that because if you do it will just escalate it.
 You have the right to live your life and be happy, don't cave to his threats.
 If he really does love his son he would see him regardless, but this is just a typical control method that people like him use.
 Other people have said things like "I'll kill you if you leave me" - does it get through to you?
 Date me.
 Meet all kinds of people.
 Do what you want.
 If he voluntarily walked out of both of your lives, at the price of willingly walking out of both of your lives, you would probably be better off without him.
 I agree, the other thing is that whether or not you're dating is none of his business.
 I didn't tell him.
 Not because he's a threat, but because he's not concerned about your personal life.
 Can you document his threats?
 You really need to.
 Quit taking his calls and make him leave a voice mail.
 Make him email or text you.
 Keep those records.
 Get a lawyer and get a divorce.
 Try legal aid if you can't afford one.
 Tell your ex-significant other that all communication needs to go through a lawyer.
 The bus driver, the person at the till, the person delivering your food, wants exact change.
 They don't realize you don't get a pile of change in the bank?
 Had someone had to take a note somewhere?
 People get lazy.
 I like to be near as near as possible because I don't like counting copper all day long.
 If you take a £20 note on the bus they will just tell you to get on the bus because they are lazy as hell.
 It is illegal to pay a certain amount in loads of coins - you can only pay something like £30 using a penny coin.
 Hello, I started University in September but like most people, I didn't immediately gel with it, obviously.
 However, I know it will take me some time to adjust as I'm a very introvert, shy, anxious, and always anxious, especially compared to the rest of the rest, but it will all take me time.
 The first night I was here all my housemates and I went out the first night and it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
 When I was sober, I went to a student union bar on my own on my own.
 But more to the point. Here's the fact.
 After about 5 months of being here, I'm not enjoying the University. I'm disillusioned with the course, I'm not enjoying the set projects, and I don't much like the course delivery.
 University is made to be much better than it seems it is.
 I started my first term badly. Due to all the piling up, student financing was delayed, adding to my level of stress, I was so worried that I was unable to make progress in my work.
 I was assigned a counsellor at uni and i saw her for about 5-6 weeks in block sessions, block sessions, and to be honest it didn't really work out because I never opened up to her to be honest.
 Only half hearted.
 Now my work load is loaded on my neck, I have to hit major deadlines, I'm depressed and the anxiety is resulting in me feeling miserable all the time.
 I no longer have a counsellor as you can only have so many sessions at a time, and I doubt they would help me much this time if they didn't help me already.
 I lack motivation, I don't feel comfortable with my lecturers, I feel like I want to give up but can't bring myself to do so because I end up with a dead end job and I aspire to be someone.
 I would rather die than be uneducated and not living the life I want to live and make matters worse by dropping out of university.
 I'm 21, I'm turning 22 this year, I don't have much time left to fail, I have to do something.
 I failed college once, and had to do another course so I could get into uni, I don't want to go through the system over and over and consistently fail.
 Can someone give me some advice please?
 Maybe go and see your doctor and see if you can see if you can get your deadline extended to try and ease the pressure a bit.
 Send an email like this post to your tutor and have him consider the mitigating circumstances. Don't worry, as they have seen all of them before, some of whom are much more uncomfortable with admission, I know as I used to work for the university administration department.
 Break up your work into chunks you can manage.
 concentrate on one bit of work at a time, obviously start with the most urgent assignments.
 Don't shut off your housemate and do well, try new things from the very beginning, keep it up now.
 You should go see your doctor, too.
 You may benefit from speaking to someone if you're always an anxious person - my friend gets therapy on the NHS because of anxiety - it makes it really normal for her.
 Try and get the deadline extended, and be honest, I'm sure your University will allow it.
 It gets hard to keep strong and keep carrying on with life.
 My mum divorced, she had a horrible time with my stepfather and was sent round the bend by the new freedom she found.
 She has epilepsy, manic-depression, and a huge anger problem.
 She was constantly horrible to me.
 When I'm at home I can't cope with her outbursts and nasty, hateful remarks.
 I'm an 18 year old who has 95% bursaries, is a full time student at a high pressure private school in 6th form and at breaking point.
 I can't work at home because she shouts at me.
 Then I got angry with my teacher.
 She's lovely one minute, like I'd have my mummy back, then the next minute she turns into the meanest, most spiteful living human.
 I didn't pass my A2 exam, I've already accepted that I was defeated and that this year of my life has made me fail.
 Who knows, I might be able to come back from this, who knows, the university offered me the most amazing offer, but I couldn't even accept it. I've never made a grade.
 I wish I could wipe her out of my life, things would be so much better without her.
 But then I thought I was just being selfish.
 But surely this wasn't meant to be like my life, was it?
 It should have been so much better.
 But I feel like I'm not in control of this downhill spiral.
 And I don't know what to do.
 Thanks for reading.
 Nice vent.
 You can't get a section on her for that.
 Does she even have a history of mental illness or diagnosis?
 You sure didn't know you wouldn't get a good grade, so if you could, you'd accept a place if you could.
 Life throws things at you all the time.
 outsider if not someone from your family.
 I had to deal with verbal abuse from my dad for about 8 years before I came to uni, and honestly the only reason I'm here is because it's the only way out.
 You work hard, if you really want to be out.
 It really sounds like you need support from somewhere else if she can't consistently give it to you.
 Can you call Childline or something like that?
 You can go to the library on a Saturday and study for a good 8 hours.
 Can you go to a friend's house to form a study group?
 Do you want her section because it's a bit of a pain in the ass and you're blaming it for all your problems?
 I know how you feel.
 My mum spit out of hell too.
 I highly recommend taking up smoking.
 Oh, tsr grew up and stopped nagging, it's a joke.
 I think in the past year or two I've become much weaker towards people and in a way my personality has dulled down in trying to make friends with some people at uni.
 But being over nice to people leads them to believe they can say or do whatever the hell they want to me.
 They have shown absolutely no respect.
 For example, I say hello to someone from uni and they ignore me, then 30 minutes later they decide they want some work and I give them some help.
 It has caused a lot of anger and distress in my life and really started to affect my concentration at university.
 Does anyone get any experience in how to handle this sort of thing, or how to go about gaining some respect again?
 Just sayin' no.
 If it isn't particularly comfortable for you, do it gradually.
 You can start by starting with "I'm sorry, but I'm busy.
 Of course you don't go over the top with it, to not go completely the opposite direction.
 If you think no, in your mind, you say no.
 When they start to realise that you don't bend over backwards for them they will start to respect you more.
 Well this really is such a bad attitude, of course you can be respected if you're nice but not nice to the point where you just let them do anything to you, that's not nice, that's a fool's attitude.
 I don't know if anyone has read this, but I just feel desperate and feel the need to tell someone.
 I left home in September and started at uni, I was incredibly anxious about doing this but delayed thinking about it until I got here, now I'm here and have been for over 2 weeks. I feel terribly overwhelmed by it all and feel unintelligent and socially awkward.
 I've been in an emotional struggle for the majority of my life, since moving to secondary school I've been struggling emotionally, I lost my dad when I was around 9 years old and used to always blame it for my feelings, I've had two periods of counselling in my life, from December 2009 until around March this year, roughly 15 months.
 At the moment I feel like the problems in my life are insurmountable and making me ever more doubtful of my always low self-esteem, I am unable to concentrate on work, often find myself becoming very quiet on social occasions and doubt myself over anything and everything.
 I have not been diagnosed by my 2 counsellors as having depression and they have suggested I don't suffer from it but it is a huge worry for me as the depression that caused my dad to die by suicide was a huge factor.
 I've tried to solve my problems before and have found exercise and meditation particularly useful, and have also tried things like self-help books and tapes, but generally I feel like this is my life, I've wasted one chance to exist and one chance to be a young man, but these feelings beat me away.
 I simply don't know what to do and when I think of what to do I never follow through with it, my friends often say I'm lazy and I can't disagree a lot of the time, I feel like people are trying to do everything they can to help and I fail time and time again.
 I'm sorry to anyone who has read this jumbled mess, and I feel a bit like a moaning self-seekers, but I truly do feel desperate.
 It is common for people's existing feelings to become more intense when they are in new situations and feel under pressure to socialize with strangers and fit into new roles, such as university students.
 I am not a health professional and can only speak from my personal experience, so I strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional about how you feel and worry about depression.
 Most people feel unintelligent and awkward when getting to uni for the first time, you're definitely not alone there, I really recommend you get an appointment with your uni counselling service, it doesn't really matter if anyone is telling you you're depressed, obviously you have some problems at the minute, you can use some support, meditate and exercise is really helpful, try to do both, but you have to engage with help and life in general to get somewhere, don't beat yourself up for feeling like you're not motivated to do anything at the minute, a lot of people feel like this and hopefully it will pass as you begin to feel better, but labels aren't as important as your experiences. You're not being kind to yourself only make your feelings worse, be kind to yourself and get some help for them.
 Good luck.
 I think a lot more people feel the same way as you do, but medicate themselves by using friends, I think it's probably not a solution as such, but it's definitely a better thing to be around your friends when you're depressed than to be alone and depressed - either way, if you fancy a chat, feel free to message me privately.
 If I were you, I would focus on idols, you aspire to someone like someone who came from a bad background and ended up successful, happy, had a family, married, etc. You don't want to be them, but someone you admire and respect.
 Focus on what you have achieved in life, you haven't stated what you studied, or indeed why you studied, do you want to experience? Do you want to go because your mum wants you to go? Do you need a degree for the career you want?
 Either way, you sum up why you're there and work your bottom off to get the best grades possible because once you get your degree, you'll have something to say (like, "Hey, I didn't fail, I worked hard and passed, so what if I did)....

 I hope this helps.
 I'm pretty much not autistic (I haven't been diagnosed as dyspraxia, but I think the doctor misdiagnosed me) but I walk on my toes nearly all the time.
 It's more comfortable for me.
 What makes them decide a toe walk is a sign of autism when it seems so random and doesn't always indicate an autism sign?
 Well, I might have a sign of something on the autism spectrum, but one or two?
 You guys know what I mean.
 Walking on toes can be a symptom of autism.
 The headache could be a symptom of a brain tumor.
 Feelings of being tired a lot of the time may be leukemia symptoms.
 The symptoms don't always apply, but when there are a lot of symptoms (which are clearly the case in this instance) it is worth noting that if nothing is noted then nothing will ever be diagnosed without a note.
 I used to walk on my toes, but that was because I was born with a strange, curled underthing that had to be straightened out by surgery two years ago.
 My brother is autistic but I haven't noticed it either, but the spectrum is so broad, and I probably have mild Asperger's, so I have communication problems and don't pick up on social reaction/body language.
 But then again, I don't have the proper diagnosis, and even if you do have some symptoms, it may not mean you have a certain condition.
 I've been told for years not to walk on my toes, so I don't walk on my toes much.
 I have dyspraxia.
 So you could be dyspraxic or have a short tendon.
 People who do dance/ gymnastics/ballet/etc do it to the point where I find it more comfortable now.
 I don't read too much into random symptoms like that.
 Hello, I'm a 12 year old girl who will be 13 in 2 days, I am a self-harming addict.
 I started cutting each individual finger off with a scissors when I was 7, and never stopped from that day on.
 It makes it worse because I have a scar on my leg from slitting the staples in my ex boyfriend's name on a staple because I didn't stop cutting if I bled.
 I had several slit holes in my arms.
 They healed and I then cut myself with a staple I stole from a school robber and a razor.
 I took around 5 paracetamol and other drugs and took them with lager and vodka when I couldn't find the cut.
 I was really tempted to cut my arms off or burn myself as I was writing this.
 I'm an addict. When one wounds, I cut again.
 I think about it every day.
 I'm 12, and my life is already sick and tired.
 This is the source of this, my dad left when I was 7 and doesn't want to know me anymore.
 He just cares about his new little girl, his wife and his new life, where I don't want to be.
 My best mate died when I was 10.
 I was in a relationship with a 16 year old boy and he was forbidden to speak to me because of what had happened and the age difference.
 My mum also suffers from Bipolar and I have depression.
 I don't want to stop.
 I don't care what is done to me, I want it done again and again to torture me, I hate myself.
 But I do love my best mate loads and he means the world to me and if I do anything he will do it for me.
 I didn't tell him but he found out.
 I don't want to hurt him, I don't want him to hurt himself.
 What do I do?
 Thanks for reading.
 Are you on any drugs or do you get any therapy?
 You should talk to your school nurse or your GP and tell him what's going on.
 There may be people in the school who you can trust and can tell a school teacher.
 People can help you if you tell them.
 If you keep it bottled up inside, it is likely to only get worse.
 Trust me, it would have been better to get these things as early as possible rather than let them get even worse.
 Please do not do this.
 I was 17 and started self harm last year, mainly cutting my arms, but stopped it a few months ago.
 It's hard but you can do it.
 I feel so much happier now, but seeing the scars reminds me of how I felt at that time and how strong it was that I wanted such a thing done to me, it hurts me deeply.
 And also strong. You can do it. I found it saved by writing poetry and keeping a journal.
 Self harm is addictive, but you can overcome it.
 Remember self harm does not define who you are.
 You can overcome it.
 So I think I've got a form of OCD because every time I go out, especially going out to university, I always find myself checking my belongings to make sure I haven't lost anything or left anything behind.
 I often have to check twice a go, and then for some reason I can't resist checking again after 30 seconds.
 Why is this?
 Am I crazy or something?
 It happens most often (when it does, but rarely) and even then it's still checked many times a day, if not many times a day, is this to any extent OCD?
 What can I do about this?
 If I don't check I get very anxious, sort of go away for 15-30 minutes after, but often there's so much anxiety I can't wait that long.
 I either feel doomed or I feel doomed if I lose my wallet or my phone.
 I just wish I could be able to go out without worrying every 2 minutes whether I'm leaving something or losing something.
 I don't really know what to do and am afraid to go to a GP.
 They will probably never hear of some compulsion like this, and I just don't know what to do.
 Do any of you have a similar ritual?
 People think I'm crazy but it's very difficult, very strange, to get you out of this.
 What advice can you give me?
 I used to do this on my way to college - had a list of items I knew I had to have on me, and was used to compulsive checking on the bus.
 I have more severe anxiety now and I think this is a warning sign - just try to wean yourself off the habit when it is relatively fresh and definitely visit your doctor - but also tell yourself not to keep checking these things - I know it's easier said than done.
 Don't worry about that, the doctor will see a much worse case.
 In my psychology class today I did a OCD class :P
 Just avoiding the compulsive act is one of the ways to get rid of it, so don't check if you've lost something and just leave it at that.
 While your anxiety level will increase for the duration, it will gradually decrease, so hopefully your OCD will disappear over time.
 That just sounds to me like you're overly anxious, rather than having really bad OCD.
 I am very obsessed, to the point that I get up 20 times a night to check, particularly to check that all the locks in my house are locked.
 Sometimes, even though I knew they were locked, I'm convinced they aren't.
 When the obsession really starts to interrupt your daily routine, I think it becomes a real problem.
 Don't worry, you're definitely not crazy, and I'm sure your GP will understand the issue.
 I went to therapy also for other reasons, and they encouraged me to pick a number, which was obviously less than 20, stick to it and cut down.
 I thought teaching was a good idea and after 5 or 20 checks, I'm still OK.
 So far I'm a lot better so far, and I think there's definitely hope for improvement for anyone who wants to.
 I'm usually pretty calm about things, I like to take things as they come and don't worry too much about them.
 However, in the last month or two I've found myself becoming really anxious about things, and I'm not talking about mere nervousness out of the blue feelings.
 I began to feel irrational panic over a variety of things that didn't even come to mind as something that would cause the alarm bells to ring in my head, things that I hadn't worried about too much beforehand.
 I'm not sure if this is due to lifestyle changes (going from an carefree student to an unemployed graduate) or if this is a sign of other issues, but it is beginning to bug me as it affects my confidence and happiness.
 I've spoken to a few people about it, including my parents, but all people think the same - I've gone through the random phase and should have held off on taking action until it was clear there was a serious problem.
 So wonder what is the best thing to do?
 Speak to your doctor and see if an anti anxiety pill can take the edge off of things?
 Would I see if I could speak to a counsellor?
 Or should I take the advice of a close person around me and just keep an eye on anxiety just until it becomes a problem?
 Well, you should not start trying to keep an eye on your anxiety, as that will make you tense and more likely to panic, and there is a death circle there.
 As soon as you start feeling a bit panicky about anything, I recommend you try to focus on something that will make you smile or feel happier.
 Or if you can't do that, get one of your friends to make you laugh when you start to feel panic. It worked for me and I suffered a random panic attack lol.
 I'm just starting to get really worried about the tiny things, although not as severe as you, as far as how things sound.
 I find talking to someone else about what makes you anxious just might help.
 Perhaps a way of not moaning but I found myself mentioning what I was worried about to my mum and seeing her react to the situation the way I should have, which made me feel better about it and make me know that it's not a big deal and I don't need to be anxious about it.
 But if it gets worse, go to the doctor.
 I have a friend who suffers from severe anxiety that prevents her from leaving the house and doing things she might otherwise do because she is so worried about what could go wrong.
 The doctor gave her medication and it made her much better.

 Some 2,500 mainly university students formed a human chain in Osaka on Sunday in protest against the US-led military campaign in Iraq, with a Japanese character spelling out "No War."
 One of the rally organizers, Miyako Fuji, 20, told the Jiji news agency, "We can't forgive this war."
 I want to join together with each of us as anti-war individuals to feel the feelings of each of each of us.
 The Jiji news agency said that over 2,000 protesters, exceeding the number expected to show up at Osaka Castle park in the city's downtown neighborhood, carried placards reading "Stop War, Love and Peace" when they formed a human chain after 5:00 p.m. (0600 GMT).
 The protest followed a string of other protests that have involved tens of thousands of peace activists across Japan since January.
 A Kyodo news agency poll released Saturday said 78 of 100 people surveyed opposed military action in Iraq.
 Separate polls by the leading Yomiuri newspaper published Tuesday showed 64 percent of the 1,846 adults felt Japan had no choice but to back the United States and only 12 percent said Japan had every reason to back the war.
 British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown on Tuesday named the current head of Britain's energy regulator as the new chairman of the Financial Services Authority's financial watchdog, the Financial Services Authority.
 Former senior banker Callum McCarthy will begin one of the most important jobs in the London financial world in September when the incumbent Howard Davies steps down.
 Davies left to become chairman of the London School of Economics, one of the best-known parts of the University of London.
 Brown said that McCarthy would bring to the Federal Security Agency a combination of private and public sector experience, senior financial service industry practices and experience as chairman of a highly successful regulatory organization.
 McCarthy is currently head of the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, which regulates Britain's privatised energy industry.
 McCarthy is a former top civil servant at the Department of Trade and Industry and previously held senior positions at Barclays Bank, BZW and Kleinwort Benson as well.
 In November 2001 the Financial Services Authority became under Davies' watch the sole British regulatory body for financial services taking on various functions from 9 separate agencies.
 Tribal mobs hacked to death at least three family members in the northeastern Indian state of Tripura for allegedly practicing witchcraft, police said Thursday.
 The spokesman said between 25 and 30 armed group men attacked the house Wednesday belonging to a quack doctor in the Tultuli region, a village 60 kilometers (40 miles) south of the Tripuras state capital Agartala, on Wednesday.
 The mob dragged out three members of the family and killed them with machete and spears before fleeing the area, the spokesman said by telephone from Agartala.
 Among the dead were 55-year-old quack doctor Nityalila Naotia, her teenage son and another family member, who people would not identify.
 According to the spokesman, Naotia is believed to be a practicing sorcerer and to have cast evil spells on the villagers with his black magic, prompting a group in the village to eliminate them.
 Police arrested 4 people for killing in connection with the killing.
 In parts of Tripura and other northeastern Indian states, superstitious beliefs, black magic and demonology are integrated with tribal customs.
 Many tribes practice a faith that is believed to be a mix of black magic and superstition.
 30 dead in week-long non-stop rain in Oman
 MUSCAT, April 19
 30 people, including five Indians, four Pakistanis, a Pakistani and a United Arab Emirates (UAE) family swept away in their car, died in a week-long heavy rain in Oman, police said Saturday.
 A family of seven were killed when a wadi (dry river) overflowed due to rains in the Wilayat region near the border with the UAE, police spokesman Abdullah al-Harthy said: "We have recovered seven bodies and a vehicle."
 Five Indians and four Pakistanis died, according to Indian and Pakistani embassy officials.
 The decomposing body of Dharam Datt Choyal, a construction worker from the western Indian state of Rajasthan, was found Friday, said Bhupinder Singh, first secretary at the Indian embassy.
 Two other Indian workers were still missing after Choyal's truck was swept up in a flash flood Monday in the capital, Muscat.
 Since the rains began two days ago, 16 people have died, police reported Wednesday.
 The sun was out on Saturday and traffic was normal in the capital with traffic running normally.
 Meteorological officials said the wet spell, which started with a bang Monday, seemed to be ending.
 Muscat's largest market, Muttrah Souq, reopened on Saturday three days after being flooded to the knees.
 A Pakistani court in the central province of Punjab has sentenced a Christian man to life imprisonment for blasphemy, police said Sunday.
 District court judge Shahid Rafiq of the industrial city of Faisalabad found Ranjha Masih guilty of defaming Koranic verses during a 1998 protest rally by the minority Christian community.
 The judge also ordered Ranjha to pay 50,000 rupees (about 870 US dollars) in fines in a verdict handed down on Saturday, they said.
 Ranjha was accused of tearing down a Koran-carrying billboard in Faisalabad during a demonstration by Christians after a Faisalabad bishop committed suicide under a 1985 blasphemous law.
 Faisalabad's Catholic bishop John Joseph, who has campaigned against the law, shot himself in the head outside a Sahiwal district court when a judge convicted Christian Ayub Masih under the law in 1998.
 Ayub Masih was charged in 1996 with blasphemous blasphemy for allegedly defending British author Salman Rushdie, whose novel The Satanic Verses infuriated radical Islamic clerics who accused Rushdie of defaming Islam.
 A Pakistani supreme court last year acquitted Ayub Masih who had denied uttering a word against Islam or the prophet Mohammad.
 blaspheming is punishable by death under the Pakistani Penal Code.
 However, blasphemers convicted in the country have never been executed.
 Christian rights activists campaigning against the against-law law introduced by the late military dictator General Zia-ul Haq said the main use of the law was persecution of Christians or settling land feuds.
 French beleaguered media group Vivendi Universal is in advanced negotiations to sell its theme park business to a US firm for around 1.5 billion dollars, the Los Angeles Times said Friday.
 The reports came as the money-lender said it planned to sell off the US unit Vivendi Universal Entertainment and other assets to focus on telecom activities and its French cable television business.
 The Times said Vivendi Universal is negotiating to sell its flagship theme park to the New York investment firm Blackstone Group, in the first step to dismantle its entertainment empire.
 Vivendi Universal officials in the United States were not immediately available for comment Friday.
 The Blackstone Group is reportedly planning to buy Vivendi's theme park division, including Universal Studios Hollywood, Florida's Universal Orlando, and Universal's interest in owning Spanish and Japanese parks, sources close to the negotiations told the paper.
 Blackstone already holds a 50% stake in the two parks that make up Universal Orlando.
 This week, Vivendi confirmed months of press speculation that it was planning to shed its entertainment assets, including the famous Universal movie studio and television assets, before the end of the year.
 At a general annual meeting on Tuesday, Chief Executive Jean-Rene Fourtou told shareholders that the sale of Vivendi Univeral Entertainment is a major goal for 2003 and negotiations are already underway for the sale.
 However , Fourtou said he had not yet received a firm offer for his giant US music business , Universal Music Group , and has not taken a final decision on its future ,
 The French utility group, once France's number one, has had to reshape itself to slash a huge debt burden of around 18 billion dollars.
 In 2002 the group recorded a net loss of 2.2 billion euros on sales of 2.85 billion euros which was the biggest ever in France.
 Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom stressed Wednesday the role of Qatar in the Middle East peace process during talks in Paris with his Qatari counterpart , sheik Hamad bin Jassem bin Jabr al-Thani .
 Shalom told a joint press conference that strong relations between the tiny Gulf state and the recently appointed Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmud Abbas could boost peace .
 We will discuss the Middle East peace process.
 Over the course of the hour-long talks, Shalom said, "We asserted that we are willing to do everything to do everything to return to the negotiating table with both Israel and the Arab world."
 Qatar is a very important country in this issue.
 He said he knew of the special relationship between the Qatari foreign minister and Abu Mazen, using the alternative name of Abbas.
 Shalom was encountering his Arab counterpart for the first time in a meeting since taking office as Israeli foreign minister on February 27th.
 Qatar has economic links with Israel but does not maintain diplomatic relations , in the face of criticism from other Arab countries .
 Shalom flew afterwards to London for talks with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw.
 US President George W. Bush told Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien in a telephone conversation Monday that he looks forward to seeing him at upcoming summits, including those of major industrialized nations and Russia, the White House said Tuesday.
 Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the two leaders will discuss the upcoming G-8 meeting, the relationship between the US and Canada and other international concerns for days before the June 1-3 summit in France.
 Both said they looked forward to seeing each other at Evian.
 Fleischer said they also touched on Afghanistan, the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the global economy.
 Bush has not definitely postponed his visit to Canada, instead choosing to host Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who has endorsed the military campaign against Iraq, amid a chill in relations over the country's opposition to the war in Iraq.
 Chretien told reporters Monday that he and Bush, who has not spoken with Chretien since late February, will discuss a wide range of issues, including Iraq, the upcoming summit of the industrial-power Group of Eight, and aid to Africa.
 We are always a good term.
 The Canadian leader said, "We disagree on just one item.
 "The prime minister and president are bachelors because India suffers from the curse of nature," the provincial chief of India's main opposition Congress party told an election rally, reports said Saturday.
 Indian Chief Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and President Abdul Kalam have offended the Hindu god of rain, Varuna, by remaining bachelor, The Times of India quoted Madhya Pradesh Minister Digvijay Singh as saying.
 A bachelor president and an unmarried prime minister rule the country.
 Singh said a Hindu book shastra says that this is very auspicious and will cause widespread heatwave and drought.
 He added that the bachelor status of President Kalam, not just Prime Minister Vajpayee, made the country a dry, arid and infertile country.
 Vajpayee's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's General Secretary Pramod Mahajan retorted that Singh's statement was beneath contempt.
 India has been reeling from a heatwave since mid-May that has killed 1403 people.
 The western desert state of Rajasthan was also bracing for a five-year straight drought there.
 The skeleton of a second baby was found in a rural home in Wisconsin, where a 22-year-old woman's dead infant was discovered June 8 in a blue plastic container, officials said Monday.
 Kristin Scott told police she had secretly given birth to two babies, one of them an unknown sex in April 2001 and the other a full-term girl on January 14, 2002 at her parents' home in Byrds Creek, Richland County.
 On Saturday, police arrested her in Abilene, Texas, where she had moved with a friend on June 2.
 She is being held on $50,000 bail on charges of first-degree reckless homicide and hiding a corpse when the infant, born in January, died.
 Scott told police she didn't tend to the baby and the baby died 30 minutes later.
 She said the baby had to die, according to the criminal complaint.
 William and Nancy Scott, the woman's parents, found the decomposing body of the first baby in their closet after going to look for a source of the foul odor in their house.
 According to the complaint, Scott told investigators he had moved those bodies sometimes between the closets of his house in Byrds Creek, his car trunk and a closet at his apartment in Richland Center before moving around in Texas.
 The sheriff's office did not release other details about the second baby.
 Palestinian security forces returned Monday to positions they held in the Gaza Strip before the 33-month-old Palestinian uprising broke out, Palestinian sources said, as Israel removed all major checkpoints in the coastal territory.
 Police officers, enjoying freedom of movement they haven't known since the Intifada exploded in September 2000, have taken up their positions across the Gaza Strip, the source said.
 The Palestinian police took over all the posts and positions they held before September 28, 2000.
 They are free to move with cars and weapons for the first time since the start of the Intifada, according to the source.
 The move marked a huge step forward in carrying forward a US-backed Middle East roadmap that aims to end months of bloodshed and create a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
 Police took up positions there and in the neighboring town of Beit Lahiya following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the northern town of Beit Hanoun late Sunday, he said.
 They are also deploying along the Israeli border.
 The handover will be a test of credibility for the Palestinian Authority, which must show that it means business when it comes to rein in hardline groups plotting attacks against the Jewish state.
 For the first time in almost three years, the Israeli Intifada (Israeli uprising) allowed free circulation of Palestinians on the trans-Gaza highway, as troops abandoned three major checkpoints across the coastal territory, for the first time in almost three years.
 Traffic flowed freely at the junction of Netzarim south of Gaza City, at Kissufim near Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, and at the Guest House junction just south of Deir al-Balah after the army withdrew.
 Three military checkpoints on the highway that runs the entire length of the Gaza Strip, transforming an ordinary 30-minute ride from the south to the north from an ordinary 30-minute ride into a gruelling two- or three-hour ordeal and coming to symbolize the horror of the occupation.
 Israel has implemented most of the agreement except for a few issues, according to the source, who pointed out that Israel still has not removed the two military observation posts at the junction of Kissufim and the Guest House.
 Several other roads remained temporarily closed but there was free movement along the trans-Gaza highway, he said.
 The Karni-Netzarim road, which runs from east to west across the route, and a section of the highway passing close to the settlement of Kfar Darom, just south of the Guest House junction, are still closed, he said, adding that they were likely to open in the coming weeks.
 Another road , leading from the southern border town of Rafah to Khan Yunis , would open within 10 days , he said .
 Addressing Palestinian complaints, Israeli military sources confirmed that troops had installed gates at the crossroads of Netzarim and the junction of the southern Guest House, but said they were only there for the time the Jewish settlers needed to use the road.
 The ban on allowing free movement for Palestinians under the age of 35 was still in force but was expected to be lifted later Monday or early Tuesday.
 The army also handed over control of the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt to the Palestinians, the source said.
 Six Palestinian police officers were allowed to return to the Palestinian section of the border crossing taken over by Israeli troops shortly after the start of the uprising.
 While Israel will finally control the zone , the 1993 Oslo accord granting the Palestinians autonomy measures must be managed jointly by Israel and the Palestinians on the Rafah border crossing to Egypt .
 Israel manned the Palestinian section for more than two years , but in principle opened the crossing in principle for movement between the two territories but has frequently closed it for reasons that are rarely explained .
 Five Iraqi civilians, including a woman, were killed Monday when their house was hit by a missile fired by a US-led coalition warplane, witnesses said.
 They said their house was located in Al-Azamiyah, one of the most populous areas of the Iraqi capital Baghdad.
 One house was destroyed in the strike and casualties were removed from the area.
 A new round of air strikes by the US-led coalition forced a new round of negotiations in Baghdad at 2:30 p.m. (1130 GMT Monday)
 They said huge explosions were heard in different parts of Baghdad and air raid sirens sounded in the capital, adding that Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery began firing back.
 Coalition leaders have repeatedly assured that every effort is to make every effort to minimize civilian casualties in the current Iraq war, but at least 130 Iraqi civilians have been reported killed since it started five days ago.
 Five Syrian bus passengers were killed and 10 others injured Sunday morning when a bus traveling near the Iraqi border was hit by a US missile, other reports reached here said.
 The vehicle carried Syrian refugees fleeing the war in Iraq.
 Tornado kills 16 in eastern China
 Hefei , July 9
 Fierce tornadoes killed 16 people and injured 162 Tuesday night, sweeping through eastern China's Wuwei County in Anhui province.
 The tornado struck several towns at 10:10 p.m. Tuesday and 2:00 a.m. Wednesday, the state disaster office said.
 57 people were still being treated in hospital for serious injuries.
 The storm affected 23,681 people, destroyed 715 houses and caused an estimated direct economic loss of 24 million yuan ( 2.9 million US dollars) , the official said.
 To date , 1786 people have been transferred to safe places .
 Rescue teams, medical staff and relief materials including tents and food have arrived in the affected areas.
 Lack of precautions blamed for avalanche accident in northwest China:
 <b>Menyuan</b> (Chinese: 縣县县; Pinyin: 縣县; traditional Chinese: 縣县; modern Chinese: 縣县) is a county in northwestern China.
 Search continued Tuesday for two outdoor tourists missing in an avalanche in the northwestern Chinese province of Qinghai, with the lack of precautions already left one dead listed as one of the main reasons for the tragedy.
 The six tourists had no experience of climbing the snow-covered mountains and had little knowledge of the terrain, said Deng Haiping, head of a state mountaineering administration organization charged with rescue operations.
 All six members of the outdoor sports club in Xining, the capital of Qinghai province, were members.
 Two of them had climbed such a mountain for the first time, said Lu Shimin, one of the three survivors.
 "They had no compass, no altitude measuring apparatus, let alone any special communications equipment, let alone the equipment usually used in mountains," Deng said.
 He also said the deadly avalanche was caused by a bold idea that the snow slide was a bold idea.
 The accident occurred Saturday afternoon, as six people were sliding down the 3,700-meter (10,000-foot) high Daban mountain at Ertanggou in Menyuan Hui Autonomous County, Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.
 Three survivors of the avalanche reported to police, who then started a rescue operation with the help of villagers.
 One body was found early Sunday morning.
 One of those on the missing list was in Hong Kong , but his identity was not defined , the rescue headquarters said .
 Deng said he could only take an id card with him, his name was only known as Hung Zhihua, and the local government was trying to find out his identity with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
 A fifth rescue team was dispatched to search for the missing and more than 140 rescuers are now involved in the operation.
 However, the rescue work was hampered by thick snow and new signs of a new avalanche, Deng said.
 ``In the last three days we have found no missing clues but two helmets,'' Deng said.
 Los Angeles officials mulled ways to accommodate Katrina evacuees
 LOS ANGELES, Sept 6
 Los Angeles County and city officials tried Tuesday to determine how best to accommodate the at least 2,000 evacuees expected to be brought to the gulf coast in the aftermath of Katrina.
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina assembled key members of her administration and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa assembled key members of his administration over the Labor Day weekend to assess the possibility of hosting thousands of displaced families who survived the disastrous hurricane, officials said.
 Molina and Villaraigosa have committed to taking at least 2,000 evacuees.
 "A Katrina evacuee task force has been created in Los Angeles city/county to assist survivors in the immediate and long-term transition, local officials announced earlier.
 Emergency service offices in California, the federal government, city and county departments and non-profit organizations such as the Red Cross coordinated local efforts.
 County supervisors and the mayor jointly activated the Los Angeles County emergency operations center to prepare for an intensive response involving evacuation assistance.
 Dozens of people have already traveled from the ruins of Louisiana and Alabama to Los Angeles County, and a shelter at the nonprofit Dream Center.
 A newly-formed task force will be prepared to assist with shelter, support services, information and coordination of private sector assistance to find more permanent housing for evacuees as soon as possible.
 Molina and Villaraigosa called on the private sector and non-profits to help provide for the needs of children and families coming into the Los Angeles area.

 Residents evacuated after massive land slide in central China
 Yichang, Hubei, April 20
 About 200 people were evacuated Sunday night, threatened by an ongoing massive land slide in central China's Hubei province, local authorities said.
 200 shelter evacuees, including teachers and residents, were evacuated from a middle school in Gaoyang, said Du Honghui, head of the Xingshan land and resource bureau.
 The continued rain has triggered a slide of 60,000 cubic meters (200,000 cubic feet) of land.
 It caused 2,000 cubic meters of rock mud to flow, inundating a nearby primary school and a village with 37 homes.
 As of 2:00 p.m. on Sunday, the ground floor of the classroom building in Gaoyang's central primary school, with all the windows, pupils' desks and chairs damaged, was covered by a meter ( yard) of deep mud.
 The playgrounds were inundated with 30-50 centimeters (10-25 inches) of mud.
 "Rescue efforts are underway and the land slide situation is being closely monitored," Du said.
 There were no reports of casualties as primary schools did not have classes over the weekend.
 Since Monday, authorities have decided to suspend primary school classes for three days.
 Up to 106 mm of rain has fallen so far.
 Weather forecasters said the rain would continue in the coming days, continuing to swell the underground water expelling from the land slide site.
 Disaster relief staff expected the land slide area to get worse due to bad weather.
 In Hubei, up to 141 mm of rainstorms have killed two people in the past three days.
 The motorcycle driver swept away as he passed the bridge.
 Others were killed in the lightening strike.
 The storm, which caused flash floods in some areas, affected nearly 80,000 people in 16 counties or cities in Hubei, the state government said.

 Nargis tragedy recounted by survivors
 YANGON, May 13
 Some cyclone survivors who came the hard way from disaster-hit home regions to seek shelter in Yangon in the aftermath of the cyclone recounted their bitter experience of the recent tropical storm Nargis, which stroke their area, survivors recounted Tuesday.
 Villagers in Laputta, in the delta division of Myanmar's Ayeyawaddy state in the southwestern Ayeyawaddy state, said they had experienced a terrible human tragedy, escaping death by storm Nargis with much hardship.
 Farmers in the village of Pinzalu, which lies far from Laputta, said it stood the hardest hit in a township with total house collapse and high tide waves driven by a cyclone storm of 20 feet (6 meters) high.
 He said that if he had been carrying his two young daughters, one of whom died shortly after in a violent storm, he would have tried to swim to escape.
 He had no alternative but to abandon his dead daughter on the waves, and tried to keep afloat for a long time holding onto a fallen tree branch nearby.
 He cried out when he found another dead daughter in his hand after the storm wind had stopped for a moment.
 He recalls how his parents were swept away by the tide waves when the tragedy started, and he was left alone to live alone.
 Many other people in his village were similarly swept away by storm waves, he said, adding that he walked to the town of Laputta afterwards after witnessing all the houses in the village under water on the way.
 Faced with hunger , he has found no drinking water and no food , trying to survive on the juice of fallen coconuts .
 Another woman villager told local media she escaped by staying on the roof of a hut but was stroke by falling bamboo because of the wind.
 Storms swept away those who could not stand the strike.
 On her way to Laputta, she said she saw many dead on the way and estimated that three-quarters of her village had been killed by the storm.
 At the nearby village of Yway Ywa, only five people remained alive, she described.
 A teacher in the village of Yay Wai Ywa spoke to the local Weekly Eleven News, saying her village was erased hours after the storm started, adding that most of the dead were female.
 "The whole village cried in the storm, 'If the world had been devastated', and some members of the family died in a series of series of accidents on the road," she said.
 She exclaimed that she had not found her dependants in Laputta but was resting in some spoiled pagoda pavilion with no shelter.
 While some well-wishers donated the gruel of millet, she said, she had to queue for it.
 Local doctors worry about the issue of hygiene as the urine disposal by tens of thousands of homeless victims has developed and in the health view also constitutes a threat to thousands of unresolved dead bodies.
 The deadly tropical cyclone Nargis, which hit five divisions and states (Yangon, Bago, Ayeyawaddy, Ayeyawaddy, Haing Gyi, Pathein, Myaungmya, Laputta, Mawlamyinegyun, Kyaiklat, Phyarpon and Bogalay) severely hit the five divisions and states on May 2 and 3 over the Bay of Bengal, covering the coast towns of Ayeyawaddy state, including Haing Gyi, Pathein, Myaungmya, Laputta, Mawlamyinegyun, Kyaiklat, Phyarpon and Bogalay, as well as 45 townships in Yangon, the biggest city in the state that sustained the heaviest casualties and infrastructure damage ever sustained by a tropical cyclone.
 An official death toll, updated until Monday, said a total of 3,938 people lost their lives in the cyclone storm and 297,700 remained missing altogether, with 1403 injured.

 The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) distributed a limited copy of the IAEA report before a meeting of its 35 members on 11 September 2007.
 The find reflected an agreement between the agency and Tehran on August 21, 2007 that was publicized by Iranian officials beginning the week of 12 August 2007.
 The accord says there will remain no issue and no ambiguity regarding Iran's nuclear program and its nuclear activities.
 The IAEA report said the work plan is a significant step forward in the work plan according to the Reuters news agency account.
 A senior U.N. official was quoted by Reuters as stating that the Iranian government's efforts to enrich uranium are slowing down.
 The IAEA report stated that Iranian officials must continue to build confidence in the scope and nature of Iran's present and future nuclear program.
 On 30 August 2007 Iranian officials stated that Iran would cooperate with the IAEA in order to be able to prevent a further round of international sanctions.
 Iranian representative to the IAEA Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated to the Fars News Agency in Tehran that the report emphasizes that there are no signs or evidence indicating that Iran's nuclear activities have been diverted or that all of Iran's nuclear materials are being audited.
 Some non-proliferation experts stated that the IAEA has ceded too much to Iran.
 In a criticism published the week of 19 August 2007 Washington-based arms control experts David Albright and Jacqueline Shire of the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) wrote that the idea of closing the file violated fundamental safeguards principles and that the agreement did not specify that Iranian officials provide the IAEA with access to key people, facilities and documents needed to verify Iran's answer to the IAEA's questions.
 Independent experts stated that Iran's latest agreement with the IAEA to allow inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information falls short of Western demands that Iran halt the production of concentrated uranium which could be used in a potential bomb.
 Bush administration State Department spokesman Tom Casey stated that Iranian officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program but that the report could offer some new details or insight into the Iranian program's development.
 Casey stated that the nuclear program continues to move forward with a nuclear program that shows the Iranian regime's continued defiance of the international community.
 Most Western non-proliferation experts stated that the August 21, 2007 agreement contained little that could dissuade policy makers in Washington, London, Paris and Berlin from moving forward with another round of Security Council sanctions.
 Experts stated that many of the transparency issues that were reported to have been resolved in the agreement on August 21, 2007 should have been previously resolved.
 Executive Director of the non-partisan think tank Arms Control Association in Washington Daryl G. Kimball stated that the agreement addresses the problem of the Iranian government pursuing enriched technology and capabilities that could lead to the production of nuclear bomb material.
 Kimball stated that the Iranian government is designing to deflect criticism and pressure and claim progress has been made.
 Iranian officials stated that in the event of more sanctions Iran would be able to reduce by collaborating with inspectors.
 The Security Council voted unanimously to impose sanctions on Iran despite the U.S. demand that the penalties be limited to the U.S. because of pressure from China and Russia.
 In an interview on state-controlled Iranian television Soltanieh stated that the report and measures make any other international intervention including the Security Council irrelevant and unjustified.

 A document was distributed to the Nuclear Suppliers Group outlining Israel's proposal that the Nuclear Suppliers Group allow international transfer of nuclear technology to States that have not signed on to non-proliferation rules.
 The proposal could complicate the Bush administration's efforts to win exemptions for India to engage in nuclear trade.
 Israeli officials convinced key groups of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines allowing the transfer of nuclear technology to States that do not sign on to non-proliferation rules.
 Countries including India, Israel and Pakistan that have not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) are prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade including the purchase of reactors, uranium fuel or yellowcake.
 The document outlining Israel's proposal was distributed to the 45 members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group in March 2007.
 The Israeli presentation was made without papers allowing for the possibility of official denial.
 A letter from the NSG chairman said the offer of the Israeli presentation was made in the context of a debate within the group over an exemption bid by Indian officials on March 17, 2007.
 India and Israel are the only nations that have not signed the treaty and Israel's proposal is eligible for admission to the NSG.
 Israel's plan offers 12 criteria for allowing trade with non-nuclear States including:
 One criterion indicates Israel's status as an undeclared nuclear weapons state and says States should be allowed to engage in nuclear trade if they apply stringent physical protection, control and accountancy measures to all nuclear weapons and nuclear facilities, sources and special nuclear materials on their territory.
 The documents were circulated on Capitol Hill in September 2007 as the Bush administration worked toward an agreement with Indian officials.
 Executive Director of the Arms Control Association in Washington Daryl Kimball stated that the Israeli documents could affect the debate over India.
 Kimball stated --
 The dynamic at the NSG is that no country official wants to be an obstacle to India being the largest and most powerful country and the United States being the most powerful.
 A consensus on India was difficult to reach at an NSG meeting in November 2007.
 Israel's proposal gives officials from some countries reason to suggest an alternative approach to specific exemptions.
 Israel's record of following international nuclear rules is good and better than India's.
 Despite ties between the Israeli government and the U.S. government, the Bush administration rejected the Israeli proposal.
 The proposal could complicate the Bush administration's efforts to win exemptions for India to engage in nuclear trade.
 President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice view the pact as an important part of the administration's foreign policy legacy.
 The deal is controversial in India and must be given approval by Congress.
 Delays in winning approval of the Indian deal could have a negative effect on the administration's foreign policy legacy with the most negative effects coming in the election year.
 State Department spokesman Tom Casey stated that the U.S. government views the Indian deal as unique and does not see it as precedent for any other country including Israel.
 Israeli embassy spokesman David Siegel stated that it is grossly inaccurate to suggest that the Israeli government is demanding exemptions or that the effort is linked to any other issue including the India debate.
 Seigel stated --
 The Israeli government has never asked theNSG for exemptions to nuclear supply guidelines or made specific requests for them.
 Israel has been recognized for its full-fledged adherence to the NSG guidelines.
 The Israeli government urged the NSG to consider adopting a generic multiple-tiered approach to nuclear technology transfer based on criteria.
 Some NSG officials have previously suggested an approach similar to the Israeli plan.
 The non-proliferation regime would be considerably enhanced if the NSG guidelines were modified as proposed by Israeli officials.

 International; proliferation
 Ahmadinejad announced an expansion of Iran's uranium production capability.
 Iran has refused to commit to halting the expansion but has hinted that the expansion may halt in the future.
 On 26 July 2008 Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stated to scholars in the northeastern city of Mashbad that Iran will expand its arsenal of enriched uranium-producing centrifuges to over 5000.
 Ahmadinejad's statement was the first assertion of expansion since it was announced in April 2008 that Iran was approaching implementation of 6000 centrifuges.
 Iran has articulate a goal of 50,000 centrifuges operating at an enrichment plant near the town of Natanz.
 The international community demands that Iran halt the production of nuclear material.
 Media reports differ on the number of centrifuges Ahmadinejad cited.
 Iranian news agencies reported that Ahmadinejad stated that Iran had 6000 working centrifuges but subsequently removed the statement from the internet.
 Another Iranian news agency stated that Ahmadinejad referred to hundreds of thousands of centrifuges.
 Experts discount the significance of Ahmadinejad's claims due to the absence of information on the function of the centrifuge.
 A Western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity in Tehran stated that the number of centrifuges is less important than whether or not the machines are operational and whether they are efficient but that Ahmadinejad's assertion hinders the resolution of the diplomatic standoff between Iran and the West.
 Arms control expert at the New America Foundation Jeffrey G. Lewis stated that the New America Foundation is aware of Iran's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but does not know the operational status of the machines.
 Diplomats and arms control experts stated that technical problems are hindering Iran's enrichment program.
 Iran has repeatedly asserted that its nuclear program's aim is only to produce electricity and that producing nuclear weapons would contradict Islamic principles.
 The majority of the US, Israel, Europe and Western arms control experts believe Iran is pursuing the capacity to produce a bomb immediately upon decision.
 Experts stated that the production of weapons-grade uranium from reactor-grade material is relatively simple.
 Ahmadinejad stated that the West is still pursuing negotiations after Iran resisted Western demands to halt Iran's nuclear activities.
 EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana recently presented two offers to Iran.
 The US- endorsed package of incentives is an incentive to cease production of enriched uranium.
 The 6-week pre-crisis freeze was a period of pre-negotiations during which Iran would not add centrifuges and the West would refrain from promoting a fourth round of economic sanctions against Iran at the UN Security Council.
 Though the Bush administration recently agreed to a proposed freeze for the freeze and dispatched Burns to Geneva, US officials have repeated statements that negotiations cannot begin before Iran has halted all enrichment-related activities that are verifiable.
 On 26 July 2008 Iran refused to respond to Solana's offer during talks in Geneva attended by US Undersecretary of State William J. Burns.
 The talks constituted the highest-level diplomatic contact between the US and Iran in nearly 30 years.
 Solana, Burns and the European envoy set a deadline for a positive response from Iran before Solana and the European envoy would initiate new sanctions including a prohibition on sales of refined petroleum products vital to Iran's economy.
 Iranian officials refused to commit themselves to stopping the expansion or observing the deadline.
 On 26 July 2008 Ahmadinejad appeared to suggest that Iran could potentially halt the expansion over a period of over 6 weeks at a higher number of centrifuges than previously expected.
 Ahmadinejad stated that the existing 5000-6000 operational centrifuges would be of no use to the West if the number of centrifuges did not increase.
 5,000 centrifuges could produce sufficient nuclear material for a power plant or an atomic bomb if highly enriched.
 6000 centrifuges continuously running could produce weapons-grade uranium sufficient for 1 bomb in 6 months.
 In May 2008 the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated that Iran possessed 3500 operational centrifuges.

 The Paris diplomatic meeting concluded with no agreement on further steps to take to pressure Iran to halt uranium enrichment at the Iranian facility in Natanz.
 Diplomats stated to the media on November 14, 2008 that officials from the United States, Europe, Russia and China did not reach an agreement at a meeting in Paris on November 13, 2008 to take further action to persuade Iran to halt uranium enrichment at Iran's Natanz facility.
 Uranium enrichment is a highly technical process that can produce fuel for nuclear power plants and can produce fissile material for atomic weapons.
 The meeting on 13 November 2008 ended with no new measures announced.
 After the meeting on 13 November 2008 the French Foreign Ministry released a statement declaring that after the meeting on 13 November 2008 the international community reaffirmed the importance of a dual-track approach to the diplomatic engagement with Iran and towards sanctions work on the dual track.
 Russia and China resist new sanctions against Iran.
 Russia and China have close political and business ties with the Islamic Republic of Iran and do not feel any domestic pressure to act against Iran.
 The United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran have no close political and business ties and the United States feels domestic pressure to act against the country.
 Russia and China hold the veto power at the Security Council.
 Russian diplomat Sergei Ryabkov was quoted by the Interfax news agency in Moscow as saying that at the meeting on 13 November 2008 the parties would not strike a deal on sanctions against Iran and that while Western countries favor sanctions against Iran China and Russia do not.
 Sergei Ryabkov attended the meeting on November 13, 2008.
 According to reports released this week Iran has made significant progress on a heavy water research reactor facility near Arak.
 An Iranian heavy water research reactor near Arak could eventually produce plutonium which could be used to make nuclear weapons.
 Satellite images published by the Institute for Science and International Security showed significant progress in construction of a heavy water research reactor facility near Arak between February 2008 and October 2008.
 David Albright stated that the Iranian heavy water research reactor near Arak has evaded the notice of the international security community.
 David Albright stated that satellite images say that the Iranian heavy water research reactor near Arak has made significant progress over the past 1 and a half years from a building frame to a largely finished facility.
 David Albright is a former arms inspector and director of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security.
 Iran stated that Iran is pursuing nuclear technology to produce energy and to conduct research.
 The United States and its Western allies suspect Iran's production efforts are a precursor to creating a nuclear weapons infrastructure.
 The production of low-grade uranium is legal under international arms control regulations.
 Iran's latest nuclear technology development shows the complex diplomatic and technical challenges facing the incoming US foreign policy team of President-elect Barack Obama's incoming administration in taking on the task of stopping Iran from mastering technology that could be used to manufacture and deliver nuclear weapons.
 Last month, when it was in power, the administration of US President George W. Bush managed to synchronize its policies with those of the leaders of the European Union, Britain, France and Germany to press for tougher sanctions against Iran and diplomatic action.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency is expected to release a critical report on Iran next week.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency.
 A new initiative on Iran's nuclear program has not emerged from the November 13, 2008 talks in Paris and hopes of imposing another set of United Nations Security Council sanctions before the end of President Bush's term have decreased.
 During the diplomatic maneuvers Iran continues to work toward masterminding nuclear and missile technology.
 Some Israeli officials stated that they were alarmed by Iran's test this week of a two-stage, solid-fueled rocket with a range of 1200 miles (2000 kilometers) that was fired.
 Tel Aviv is less than 650 miles from Iranian territory.

 A high-security Russian laboratory complex storing anthrax, plague and other deadly bacterium faces loss of electricity due to lack of payment to electricity utility Mosenergo.
 A large repository of deadly anthrax, plague and other deadly bacterium stored in a high-security Russian laboratory complex 100 miles south of Moscow threatens to lose electricity.
 Electricity officials from the Moscow region's Mosenergo electricity utility recently arrived at a Russian laboratory complex and threatened to turn off the electricity due to lack of payment.
 The Russian laboratory complex is a 90-building campus and served as a secret site for secret biological weapons programs during the Soviet era.
 An incorrect headline in the Izvestia newspaper stated that a deadly virus from a Moscow regional depository has threatened Moscow.
 No virus was found at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology in Obolensk.
 Every kind of bacterium that has been studied for use in the Soviet Union's secret biological weapons program is in the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology at the State Scientific Center where the deadly bacterium is studied.
 A large virus repository is located in Siberia.
 Russian and Western officials stated that the cut-off of power at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology was unlikely to result in any threat to public health.
 Russian and Western officials stated that there is not enough certainty to be able to know if the loss of power at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is a public health threat.
 General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology has quite a reliable and reliable system for emergency protection.
 General Nikolai N. Urakov is a longtime director of the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology.
 The State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is working with Western scientists to convert the complex into a biomedicine manufacturing site.
 General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that the scientists at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology were scared of this sudden shut-down of electricity because of this kind of psychological pressure.
 General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that if power is shut down at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology all bacteriological experiments under way will have to be destroyed by scientists.
 General Nikolai N. Urakov would like the United States and Western countries, which have contributed about $6 million to the transformation of the former bioweapon complex, to contribute another $500,000 a year to pay the electric bills and arrears of the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology.
 An American scientist who works closely with the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology stated that it is the Russian government's responsibility to pay the State Scientific Center's electric bill.
 Western aid to convert General Nikolai N. Urakov's bioweapon laboratory at one time was peaked in 1997 when it was learned that Iran had offered to purchase experts from the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology.
 It is known that the sense of crisis is being orchestrated by Russian scientists and military leaders who are now depending on Western financing to destroy nuclear, chemical and biological weapons in order to increase finance.
 American scientist Randall Lee Beatty works at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology in Obolensk.
 Beatty stated that this threat of electricity cuts at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is a crisis.
 Randall Lee Beatty is director of the International Science and Technology Center.
 The International Science and Technology Center is financed approximately half of General Nikolai N. Urakov's budget to support about 350 Russian scientists and technicians in biowarfare.
 Randall Lee Beatty stated that it is known that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology has not paid its electricity bill for 14 months.
 Randall Lee Beatty stated that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is one of the most important archives of dangerous pathogen information in the world and that the destruction of the institute due to non-payment of electricity utility bills is shameful.
 Approximately 30000 strains of bacterium are stored at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology and many of them are stored in cryogenic caskets cooled in liquid nitrogen and isolated from the environment in layered enclosures and oversize air handling systems that all depend on electricity for their function.
 The greatest danger from the shut-down of electric power at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is that living germs that are currently preserved in a frozen state will be defrosted.
 Biological warfare expert at the Monterey Institute of International Studies Raymond Zilinskas stated that the main threat to the organism is not the power cut to the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology but rather the possibility of escape from the organism.
 Raymond Zilinskas stated that in the worst cases the bacterium is defrosted from -70 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and the clean-up afterward is a real mess because it is certain that not all the bacterium will die because it is not certain whether all the bacterium will die.
 Another example is the confrontation between the Mosenergo electricity utility and the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology in Obolensk, where the basic capitalist imperative to sustain enterprises could dangerously clash with the old remains of Soviet weapons science.
 Russia's National Power Company cut off electricity to strategic bases where nuclear missiles stand on high alert due to an overdue power bill in 2000.
 Nuclear missile silos do not lose power.
 Armed troops marched to the substation and turned the power back on.
 National company United energy systems (UES) cut power in January and February 2001 to a number of military installations around Russia.
 Military installations that lost power included a Kamchatka space forces monitoring center.
 In most cases the military installations cut off from electricity were quickly restored.
 The investigation has often shown a tug of war between the utility and the military that forces the military to spend money on electricity power with funds from the budget instead of on other uses.
 Some of the budget cuts, at times, included building a country residence for the generals, including:

 Brazil implemented a law allowing the Air Force to target drug trafficking aircraft in Brazilian airspace.
 The US is concerned about liability if civilian planes are misidentified.
 Brazil announced that the Air Force will begin shooting down aircraft used to trafficking illegal drugs in Brazilian airspace.
 The plan requires eight steps of precautionary steps before the order to shoot down the plane can be issued.
 Prior to the policy taking effect in late October 2004, a publicity campaign notified ranchers and others that they needed to file a flight plan.
 The law permitting such action was originally approved in 1998 but President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of the year 1995-2003 never put the policy into effect.
 The United States dissuaded Cardoso from signing the decree because of concerns that the accidental downing of civilian aircraft could expose the Brazilian government and companies to lawsuits.
 In April 2001 the United States reduced its previous support for operations targeting drug-running aircraft when a Peruvian jet shot down a small plane misidentified as a drug carrier and killed a US missionary and his children.
 Relatives of the victims sued the US government and won a settlement because the US government provided intelligence and technical support for the operation.
 A US State Department official stated --
 US law may forbid assistance to countries that implement shoot-down laws under certain conditions.
 The US agreed with Brazil's assessment that the threat posed by drug traffickers is very serious and increasing.
 The US government is consulting with the Brazilian government on US law provisions.
 Brazilian Defense Minister Jose Viegas stated that Brazil encountered difficulties in securing US support for the plan but recent bilateral talks have led to the certainty that the US government will accept the decree without exposing Brazil to commercial sanctions.
 Brazilian officials expressed hope that the US will endorse the policy before it goes into effect.
 The US is scheduled to provide Brazil with 10.2 million dollars in 2004 in drug and law enforcement aid.
 Former Air Force chief and current director of the Air Institute at Rio de Janeiro's Estacio de Sa University Mauro Jose Miranda Gandra stated that the government's step towards the measure is a courageous step but the impact could be more political than practical due to the restrictions the Brazilian government imposes on itself.
 Brazilian officials stated that the policy may not apply against aircraft on which children were on board.
 Viegas stated that the limit was necessary.
 Gandra stated that the provision undermined the essential purpose of the decree by granting immunity to drug-smuggling aircraft carrying children and thus introducing the possibility of the use of kidnapped children as human shields.
 Viegas stated in an interview in Brasilia that the government will use laws to more powerful dissuasions to dissuade drug traffickers who had previously entered Brazilian airspace without feeling threatened by the Air Force.
 The deteriorating public security situation regarding increasingly powerful and violent drug gangs in Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro in particular has prompted the government to take action.
 Rio de Janeiro's drug gangs have more firepower than the police and have successfully attacked police stations and forced businesses and schools to close.
 In a 2003 interview with a foreign correspondent President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva stated --
 The policy is a matter of national sovereignty and security.
 Some pilots of drug-running aircraft felt so confident in their immunity that they made obscene gestures at pursuing Brazilian Air Force pilots as a retribute.
 The law's constitutionality is in question under Brazilian law which prohibits the death penalty as a punishment for criminal acts.
 Some legal experts and other commentators stated that the statute amounts to a de facto execution of a drug trafficker contrary to the government's claims.
 The daily O Estado de Sao Paolo stated in an editorial the week of 18 July 2004 - 24 July 2004 that the extreme measures raise ethical and juridical problems that exceed any potential benefits.
 The penalty is applied extrajudicial under an administrative decision by the Air Force commander.
 These people gained a living and death power over crew members and regular, non-stop passengers.
 In 2002 Brazil inaugurated a 1.4 billion dollar SIVAM radar system that will allow the government to monitor air activity throughout the expanses of the Amazon basin for the first time.
 The system uses American technology.
 Illegal flights initially declined by 30 percent due to concern about the improved tracking capability of traffickers but subsequently re-accelerated.
 Brazil has recorded 4,128 unauthorised flights in 2003.
 Some of these flights are innocent violations of the rights of ranchers who fly between plantations in the Amazon.
 Viegas stated that deliberate violations of Brazilian airspace have increased significantly with drug smugglers apparently aware of the government's inability to retaliate.
 In April 2001 Brazil's most notorious drug dealer and Rio de Janeiro's most notorious drug boss Fernandinho Beira-Mar was captured in Colombia in a gun-for-drugs pipeline involving leftist guerrillas.
 Brazil's northern Amazon corridor has become an increasingly busy and essential route for the global drug trade and is used to smuggle arms, gold and diamonds.
 One of the most important drug and gun smuggling routes to supply cocaine to Europe runs across Colombia and Suriname and is reported to run across the northern tier of the Amazon.
 Colombia is the only country that currently has a policy of targeting drug-trafficking aircraft.
 Colombia is a source of much of the cocaine and heroin sold in the United States.

 The Venezuelan president's weapons deals with Russia, his curbs on military cooperation with the United States and plans to train as many as two million Venezuelan civilians to repel a possible superpower invasion have worried both the United States and his domestic critics.
 Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's weapons deal with Russia, his curbs on military cooperation with the United States and his plans to train as many as two million civilians to repel a possible invasion by an imperialist superpower have worried the United States and domestic critics of Chavez as well as former military officers on the left.
 Chavez insists the move is purely defensive and that it was born of the overdue need to update obsolete military hardware and protect Venezuela from nations that might want to control it.
 Venezuela is the largest petroleum producer in South America.
 Chavez's domestic opponents scoffed at the idea of a US invasion of Venezuela ever happening, charging that Chavez's true intention was to arm a huge cadre of loyal reservists to protect him from any internal uprising and pose a militarized counterweight to US influence in Latin America.
 Chavez is a major ally of Cuban leader Fidel Castro and has grown closer to him.
 The purchase of arms and indoctrination of civilian militias is even more troublesome, according to Chavez detractors in the US government, because it could be part of a strategy to restructure Venezuelan democracy under a Cuban-style militarized socialist image, fomenting a leftist revolution throughout South America.
 US military strategists say they are increasingly concerned that such a revolution could be fomented by radical moves inspired by Chavez.
 The political mainstream in Latin America has shifted leftward since the late 1990s.
 This shift to the left is largely a reaction to the perceived failure of free market economics.
 The leftists were elected to lead Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Ecuador and Venezuela.
 Chavez supporters at home countered that the United States has a century-long history of open and covert armed and covert intervention in Latin America's domestic politics, saying it has no right to question Venezuela's defense preparedness.
 Carlos Roque Espinoza Leon said the Venezuelans never asked what the US Marines were doing.
 Espinoza Leon is a defense specialist and a pro-Chavista member of Venezuela's National Assembly who serves in the Venezuelan National Assembly.
 Espinoza said Peru has 500,000 rifles and no one has said anything.
 Espinoza said no one is complaining that Colombia is the most militarized country in Latin America.
 Espinoza said the US history is full of aggression in Latin America.
 "The Venezuelans must do whatever is necessary to protect themselves," Espinoza said.
 To his fame, Chavez has said that the so-called Venezuelan Bolivarian Revolution was peaceful, but armed.
 Chavez was first elected in 1998 and the independent Datanalisis polling firm rates his popularity at 71 percent.
 In Russia, China and Iran, Chavez is looking for allies to promote a multi-polar world to counter US dominance, encouraging grass-roots moves in Latin America to throw off US government influence, said Alberto Garrido, a Venezuelan military analyst.
 Lorenzo Campos is a farmer in the northern Venezuelan state of Anzoategui and a reservist.
 Campos said the Venezuelans want the world to know that they are not prepared to attack anyone and that their mission is to protect Venezuela.
 In May 2005 Chavez's government announced details of a deal with a Russian firm to purchase 100000 AK-103 assault rifles with 30 rounds of ammunition each for $18.6 million and to transfer technology to Venezuela to manufacture the rifles.
 The deal works out to $ 186.22 per rifle, per rifle.
 This price is considerably less than the 825-850 dollar price of the same weapons ordered by US mail.
 The Venezuelan government also intends to buy 10 helicopters from Russia, 10 transport planes from Spain and six naval craft from Spain.
 Venezuelan officials said the government is negotiating with Brazil to buy around 24 air support and training planes.
 Chavez insisted, and even his staunchest military critics here -- even his most staunch critics -- agreed the purchase was essential to update old weaponry, such as the decades-old FAL rifles from Belgium's military.
 Retired General Fernando Ochoa Antich said it is exaggerated to say that Chavez is engaged in an arms build-up.
 Ochoa was defense minister in 1992 during a failed coup against then-colonel Chavez.
 Ochoa stated that Venezuela has not purchased arms in the past 25 years and said that Chavez is not aggressive and is not threatening his neighbors with weapons.
 Ochoa said that Venezuela has never bought arms from Russia before and suggested that Chavez is buying them to become independent from the US.
 Ochoa asked why Chavez bought a rifle caliber popular with subvertive forces in Latin America and stated that Chavez's political support for radical left-wing moves makes him a continent-wide menace.
 The US Pentagon openly questioned what Chavez was doing with the old FAL rifles, and whether he could share weapons or ammunition with Latin American guerrilla forces.
 The US government has provided no evidence that Chavez armed or funded the left-wing insurgency.
 Military analysts and military specialists who have analyzed Colombian FARC guerrillas say the rebels have plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking and have no interest in old Belgian rifles or Chavez's assistance.
 A study published in 2003 by the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) reported that more than half of the weapons seized by Colombian guerrillas from the foreign military in 1998-2001 were of Venezuelan origin.
 The implication is that the guerrillas may have been aided by corrupt or sympathetic members of the Venezuelan military.
 The ideological and ideological training of the military and new civilian reservists, which Chavez has said he has in mind, could be more distressful for Chavez's domestic opponents.
 Earlier in 2005 Chavez called for the so-called "revolutionary units" to start preparing the public to resist superpower aggressors and said the first step toward this would be training 100,000 to 200,000 volunteers to back up the active-duty armed forces in the coming years.
 Military analysts estimate that Venezuela's active-duty armed forces number 83,000.
 People's defense units were created in neighborhoods, state companies, and the Free University established under Chavez, and they report directly to the President.
 The government insists that the reserves support the armed forces and will not act as a fifth column against a possible coup against Chavez.
 Espinoza said reserves should not be used for troops that shock any political party and that in a civil war each person decides which side to take.
 General Julio Ramon Quintero Viloria is the reserve commander.
 Quintero said in an interview that the armed forces hope to train 50,000 civilians per weekend in the second half of 2005, and possibly 300,000 more in 2006.
 Quintero said the Venezuelan people do not want to be a colony of any empire and must be ready for any empire.
 200,000 reservists and the Venezuelan navy engaged in massive war games in June 2005 to repel a stronger invading country.
 40 employees of state oil companies participated in a similar exercise in June 2005 with 1200 soldiers.
 The pro-Chavez circles here warned of " asymmetric warfare."
 " asymmetric warfare" is a term coined by US military strategists that describes conflicts between not equal combatants in which the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics.
 Over the past five years , the US government has given Colombia 3.3 billion dollars , most of it in military aid .
 Chavez loyalists fear that the US government could instigate a proxy war between Colombia and Venezuela as a way to oust Chavez and control Venezuelan oil.
 In an interview, a senior US official dismissed the notion that the U.S. government wanted to invade Venezuela as "completely and utterly nonsense."
 "The Chavez side wishes to make a negative relationship happen because of their political calculations that Mr. Chavez will reach power by constantly confronting the US," the official said.
 Another development troubling the United States is Chavez's rollback of military cooperation and joint exercises.
 The US military has had a Cooperation Office in Venezuela's fort for 50 years.
 Chavez shut it down in 2004.
 5 US military trainers and students participating in the exchange program were ordered to leave the country in April 2005.
 Analysts say Chavez is likely to try to indoctrinate his public and his armed forces.
 Analysts say it is not proof that Chavez is using those forces to aid leftist revolutions elsewhere.

 Hill is the United States head of negotiations on North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
 Hill stated that stalled efforts to dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons program could move ahead after the June 16-17, 2007 weekend when International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors were invited by Pyongyang officials to visit Pyongyang for talks on verifying and monitoring the shut down.
 Hill stated following talks with Chinese negotiator Wu Dawei that the shutdown was long anticipated.
 Hill stated that it is possible to shut down in the weeks to come but impossible in the months to come.
 The Associated Press reported from Vienna, Austria that the IAEA stated on 18 June 2007 that a team would visit Pyongyang the week of 24 June 2007 to discuss the manner in which inspectors would verify the shut-down.
 Hill stated that IAEA inspectors will hold talks with Pyongyang officials on sealing the reactor including installing television monitors at the site.
 North Korean officials refused to proceed with the agreement to begin decommissioning the Yongbyon reactor in February 2007 until 25 million dollars worth of funds in a North Korean-linked account held in a Macao bank had been transferred to North Korea.
 The money was frozen as United States officials accused Banco Delta Asia of complicity in financial crime on behalf of North Korea.
 The funds were wired to the New York Federal Reserve Bank on June 14, 2007 after months of disagreement over the method of returning the funds.
 The funds are supposed to be sent to Russia's Central Bank before being transferred to accounts controlled by the North Korean government at Russian commercial banks.
 Hill stated that there will be talks the week of 17 June 2007 between disarmament negotiators from Russia, South Korea and Japan to talk about steps to recoup some of the time lost in organizing the financial transfer.
 The discussions will also involve setting a timetable for the resumption of 6-nation arms control talks.
 Under the agreement reached in February 2007 North Korean officials pledged to shut down the Yongbyon reactor and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown in return for a shipment of 50,000 tons of fuel oil.
 In the next phase of the agreement, North Korean officials will declare all nuclear programs and disabled all facilities in return for a further 950000 tons of fuel oil.
 Hill stated that technically the next phase of the agreement could be concluded by December 2007.

 A leading arms control expert criticized the new nuclear activities plan released by Iran and the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as ineffective and dangerous.
 On August 27, 2007 Iran and the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released a plan to resolve the issue by December 2007.
 The issue has been unresolved for four years.
 The plan is meant to allay suspicions about Iran's past nuclear activities.
 Agency officials stated that the plan was a breakthrough.
 On 28 August 2007 Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stated at a news conference in Tehran --
 The investigation into Iran's nuclear activities is now closed.
 None of the other members of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would cooperate as well as Iran would.
 Iran is a nuclear nation.
 Iran has a nuclear fuel cycle.
 Iran will not succumb to international pressure to curb its nuclear project.
 Iran's nuclear project is for peaceful purposes.
 The United States and some European nations believe Iran's nuclear project is to make nuclear weapons.
 Several Western governments and leading arms control experts stated that Iran is attempting to avoid further punishment by the U.N. Security Council.
 Western Governments include the United States and France.
 Government and experts believe Iran made the attempt.
 The arms control process is slow.
 Answers to questions about Iran's past violations of the treaty were avoided.
 physicist and president of the Institute for Science and International Security David Albright stated --
 Iran's claims were unverifiable.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency has no access to the people, documents and sites.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency would lose the right to any further questions in the future.
 Unusual developments have set a bad precedent.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency may have been duped because the Agency was eager for a deal.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency plan was announced.
 Iran resolved the question of its past plutonium experiments without explaining how.
 Senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies Mark Fitzpatrick stated --
 The International Atomic Energy Agency's plan is superficial.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency's plan has drawn out negotiations for many months.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency's plans could leave Iran with an incomplete and misleading answer.
 The International Institute for Strategic Studies is located in London.
 Plutonium is the material that can be used to make nuclear weapons.
 The Institute for Science and International Security is a private research organization located in Washington.

 The Nuclear Suppliers Group list shows that since 1998 approximately 75 countries have been denied the purchase of nuclear-related materials from Iran on suspicion that the materials could be used to build a bomb.
 The Nuclear Suppliers Group list shows that since 1998 approximately 75 countries have been denied the purchase of nuclear-related materials from Iran on suspicion that the materials could be used to build a bomb.
 The 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group is an offshoot of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and is charged with monitoring international trade to ensure that nuclear technology transferred for peaceful purposes is not directed for military use.
 The Nuclear Suppliers Group is composed of technologically advanced countries.
 A statement from the Nuclear Suppliers Group mission mission mission said countries would act on an individual basis to block trade that violates export controls devised to maintain international cooperation in peaceful use of nuclear energy.
 The Nuclear Suppliers Group has no enforcement power beyond to notify companies when they violate its guidelines.
 The Nuclear Suppliers Group keeps the data private and meets in large secret.
 Most of the purchases have been denied since 2002 and most of the denials have resulted in intervention by members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.
 Diplomats from countries interested in exposing the extent of Iran's efforts to acquire so-called dual use items that could be converted to weapons production have been apprised of the list of countries denying trade.
 The list is availble only if the diplomats and the countries from which they are from are not identified.
 The list named companies from Australia, Finland, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates and Iran as companies prevented from carrying out the deal because of suspected military usefulness of the sale items.
 The list of items offered for sale as part of the blocked deal includes nickel powder, petrochemical plant components, compressors, furnaces, refineries, steel flanges and fitting, electron microscopes, radiometric ore sorting machines, valves and tubes, lasers, rotating drilling rigs, mass spectrometers and nitrate production plants.
 Iranian end-use organizations include the Iranian government and its Atomic Energy Organization, power, engineering, petrochemical, oil and gas refineries, aircraft industry, schools, universities, engine manufacturers, mineral research centers, helicopter support companies and plasma physics centers.
 Diplomats stated that the 75 denials represented only the actions of 7 of the 45 member states.
 Diplomats stated that the actual number of denied sales of dual use products to Iran is probably much higher than 75.
 Western diplomats stated that as the standoff with Iran continues over Iran's nuclear program the Government in Tehran is unwittingly using front companies to receive and convert technology for weapons production.
 Iran has signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty but is not a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.

 Iran's Fars news agency stated that hundreds of Shiite-related websites have been defaced or blocked by hackers known as the group XP.
 Iraq's official website of Shiite leader Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani was one of the blocked websites that was defaced and blocked.
 On the defaced website the group XP stated that any website containing material contrary to Sunni teachings was hacked.
 Iraq's official website of Shi'ite religious leader Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani was defaced and blocked in a cyber attack on a Shi'ite-related site and blocked.
 It was unclear whether the attacks began on September 18, 2008 or the morning of September 19, 2008.
 On the evening of 19 September 2008 Al-Sistani's website was down.
 Another website related to one of Al-Sistani's religious organizations, www.al-shia.com, was also affected.
 The alternative address is www.sistani.com which is still operational.
 The Iranian Fars news agency stated that the XP group blocked access to approximately 300 Shiite-related sites on September 18 and 19, 2008.
 The hacking claims and Iran's assertion that the XP group is based in the United Arab Emirates cannot be independently verified.
 On 19 September 2008 several Iranian news sites stated that many of the Shiite and Iranian-related web sites that were attacked were running normally again and were unaffected.
 The statement signed by the XP group was posted on the home page of Al-Sistani's web site and stated that the attack was carried out on behalf of the Sunni Muslim group.
 According to the statement --
 XP has carried out similar attacks on other Shiite sites in the Persian Gulf and Iraq.
 XP erased the sites as it did with other Rafidha sites.
 Rafidha means reject and is an insult used by Sunni extremists to describe Shiites.
 Al-Sistani promoted sexual deviance and the Iranian agenda in Iraq as he was born in Iran.
 Any website with material contrary to Sunni Islamic teaching will be punished.
 The statement also consisted of a video clip from American comedian Bill Maher's YouTube clip which ridicules Al-Sistani's fatwa on whether married couples may be permitted certain positions of sexual intercourse.
 The office of the ayatollah in Najaf declined to comment on the cyber attacks.
 Fars reported that the counter-attacks were carried out against two major Wahhabist web sites belonging to the puritanical strain of Sunni Islam that is dominant in Saudi Arabia.

 A Somali pirate who hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms was approaching a deal to release the ship.
 Questions have emerged regarding arms shipments via the route to Kenya and possible clandestine deals between Kenya and South Sudan.
 Maritime officials and associates of Somali pirates who hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms stated on October 8, 2008 that the pirates may soon collect a ransom for the Ukrainian freighter which was hijacked on September 25, 2008.
 After difficult negotiations likened to bazaar-style haggling among several people involved in the negotiations, the parties came close to reaching a deal to pay the pirates millions of dollars and free the ship.
 businessman Ahmed Omar from Xarardheere in Somalia stated that the pirates agreed to a ransom of approximately 8 million U.S. dollars (4 million euro) from the ship's owners and that the ship could be freed by October 8 or 9, 2008.
 Xarardheere is a notorious pirate base on the Somali coast.
 Maritime officials in Kenya stated that critical details have yet to be agreed upon.
 One such detail involved a pirate's request for guarantees that the armada of American warships currently encircling the pirates would not arrest or attack them.
 An anonymous Kenyan maritime official stated that such negotiations are complex and involve more than financial aspects.
 Officials stated on October 8, 2008 that there was progress and that the parties were approaching an agreement.
 The pirates initially requested 35 million U.S. dollars (22 million euro) and then reduced it to 20 million U.S. dollars.
 The pirates have consistently expressed willingness to negotiate with financial figures.
 More than 25 ships were hijacked off the Somali coast in 2008 for ransom typically for between 1 and 2 million U.S. dollars.
 The pirate on board the Ukrainian ship stated that the ship, its cargo and the 20 sailors on board will be released once payment is paid in United States dollars and the pirates prefer 100 dollar bills.
 The question is the original destination of the arms shipment that was on board the Ukrainian ship.
 The Kenyan government claimed the weapons on board were shipped to Kenya's military shortly after the freighter was hijacked on 25 September 2008.
 The ship was on the route to Kenya's main port of Mombasa.
 The weapons on board the ship included 33 T-72 tanks, 150 grenade launchers, 6 anti-aircraft guns and large quantities of ammunition.
 Evidence subsequently emerged that the weapons were part of a clandestine arms deal between Kenya and the separatist region of Southern Sudan.
 The deal is most likely to remain secret unless the pirates hijack a ship and begin speaking to the media through satellite phones.
 Ukrainian officials have been adamant in denying any wrongdoing.
 Ukrainian diplomat in Kenya Oleh Belokolos stated --
 Ukraine does not supply any armaments to the Government of South Sudan or has any plans to do so.
 All the appropriate paperwork has been validated.
 Ukraine abide by all United Nations rules and arms control agreements.
 After the collapse of the Soviet Union Ukraine inherited an enormous stockpile of weaponry and is now in a major arms deal.
 Kenya's deal with Ukraine is considered suspicious because Kenya mostly relies on the United Kingdom and other Western countries for its heavy weapons supplies.
 Kenyan politicians demanded answers and called for several commissions to be set up to examine the situation.
 South Sudan is an autonomous region that currently increases its military and uses Soviet-designed tanks.
 The United States military stated its priority was to make sure the ship did not unload weapons and that the weapons were not sold to Islamic insurgents in Somalia.
 The pirates denied any interest in weapons and claimed they were unaware that the cargo included tanks when they hijacked the ship.
 Last week pirate spokesman Sugule Ali stated in an interview that the pirates' sole interest in the deal was money.

 Head of the U.N. Drug Office Antonio Maria Costa said Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban have cut back on poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of funding for the insurgency.
 Head of the U.N. Drug Office Antonio Maria Costa said Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban have cut back on poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of funding for the insurgency.
 Costa said this to reporters last week as the U.N. Drug Office prepared to release its latest survey of Afghanistan's opium crop.
 The survey showed that poppy cultivation has retreated in much of Afghanistan and poppy cultivation is overwhelmingly concentrated in 34 of the 34 provinces where the insurgency remains strong, mostly in the south.
 The survey was issued on November 27, 2008.
 The United Nations found that the reduction of the amount of land devoted to opium in Afghanistan by 19 percent resulted in a drop in total opium production by just 6 percent despite a drop in total opium tonnage by 6 percent.
 The study stated that high output per acre was attributed to a good southern growing season.
 The southern region is a heavily irrigated area where the Taliban maintain a strong presence in the 5 provinces and have systematically encouraged opium cultivation to finance their insurgency for several years.
 The U.N. estimates that insurgents made much of the opium trade $300 million last year.
 Costa said a lot of the war effort could be funded by between two and three billion dollars.
 The Taliban have produced an amount of opium far exceeding world demand due to three successive years of bumper crops.
 Costa said the result would be a glut that would depress prices which would drop approximately 20 percent.
 Costa said there is evidence that the Taliban, drug lords and even some farmers stockpiled opium because prices had not already collapsed.
 The increased amount is also being processed in Afghanistan.
 Costa added that the insurgents held a significant amount of opium.
 Costa said there was a surplus as much as 11,000 tons (more than twice the world's demand over the past three years) and threatened to devalue their stockpiles.
 The United Nations found Afghanistan produced 8500 tons of opium in 2008.
 The world demand is estimated to be about 440,000 tons per year.
 The Taliban have taken a passive stance in cultivation this year and are putting less pressure on Afghan farmers to plant opium poppies.
 Then this supports the current prices.
 Costa is an Italian diplomat who served for 6 years in the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime.

 The Citizen newspaper stated on October 6, 2001 that it is illegal for South Africans to be involved in mercenary activities or to render assistance to the foreign military inside or outside South Africa.
 The Citizen newspaper stated that on 5 October 2001 the South African Foreign Ministry announced that the South African government had imposed a ban on mercenary activities following reports that 1,000 Muslim military trainers had enlisted in South Africa to leave the country for Afghanistan to fight for the Taliban against the United States.
 The report claimed that 1,000 military-trained Muslim men volunteered for their service and received backing from local businessmen under a group called Muslims Against Illegitimate Leaders.
 The report claimed that 1,000 of the men were all muslims with military training and over the age of 18.
 <b>Muslims Against Illegitimate Leaders</b> is a Cape Town-based group.
 The Muslim Judicial Council refuted the report.
 South Africa's Foreign Ministry stated that South Africa's Foreign Military Assistance Act prohibits the recruitment of people from inside or outside South Africa as mercenaries or foreign military assistance.
 South Africa's Foreign Military Assistance Act (FMAA) means that people will not be allowed to offer military assistance to States, organs, groups or other countries unless granted permission by the National Conventional Arms Control Committee.

 Montesinos was sentenced to 9 years and 4 months in prison on the conviction.
 Montesinos plans to appeal the sentence.
 Former Peruvian spy chief in the government of ex-president Alberto Fujimori Vladimiro Montesinos was convicted on July 1, 2002 of illegally taking control of the National Intelligence Service when he was only supposed to be an advisor to the spy agency.
 Montesinos was sentenced to 9 years and 4 months in prison for abuse of authority.
 The sentence also ordered Montesinos to pay a 3 million dollar fine to the state as compensation.
 Anti-corruption judge Saul Pena stated that Montesinos admitted to charges of abuse of authority.
 This is the first ruling in more than 50 charges against Montesinos including corruption, drug trafficking, dealing in illegal arms and human rights violations.
 Montesinos is alleged to have run a network of bribes.
 A leaked videotape showed Montesinos bribing a congressman to switch to the government party and triggered events that culminated in Fujimori's resignation in November 2000.
 Fujimori has been accused of dereliction of duty and embezzlement and has been in exile in Japan since his resignation to avoid legal action by Peruvian authorities under the protection of dual nationality.
 Montesinos fled Peru in October 2000 but was captured on June 23, 2001 in Venezuela.
 Montesinos heard the sentences at the port of Callao Naval Base where he has been imprisoned since 2001.
 Montesinos stated that he is consulting with defense lawyers regarding his appeal.

 Hong Kong police are trying to prevent Triad or transnational criminal syndicates from engaging in criminal activities.
 Hong Kong police recently smashed transnational theft syndicates specializing in exploiting youngsters to commit various crimes, cross-border criminal syndicates and local triad gangs.
 The Oriental Daily News opined that Hong Kong police 's recent efforts to cut down five of the so-called " so-called leaders of the Triad branch or " district team leaders " within a short period of three weeks have demonstrated the Hong Kong police 's determination to eradicate criminal activities .
 Hong Kong police recently worked closely with Guangdong 's Public Security Bureau for intelligence exchange and carried out a series of raids and operations in the series .
 Hong Kong police cracked down on triad activities from 18 July 2002 to 24 July 2002 including drug trafficking, illegal possession of arms, theft, burglary, robbery, sales of pirate records and obscene material, cigarettes and duty-free cigarettes and trafficking of dangerous drugs.
 On 24 July 2002 police were reported to have dispatched over 100 staff to storm a propitiated dance and wine party organized at a disco nightclub in Mongkok, Kowloon to settle some disputes between 2 Triad groups.
 Police eventually arrested 3 branch leaders and 14 core members of Triad.
 Police sources confirmed to the Xinhua News Agency on July 25, 2002 that all 17 arrested people were still being detained for questioning.
 The Hong Kong police source was quoted as saying that the operation succeeded in netting all 17 people as a result of efforts by the police to infiltrate the relevant gangs here .
 Police sources also intimated that more crackdowns by Hong Kong police on other Triad gangs would follow.
 Hong Kong police efforts to fight off criminal organizers involve active cooperation with police in the Chinese mainland and other regions as well as Hong Kong police.
 The first so-called target conference of the International Drug Enforcement Conference in the Far East was held in Hong Kong earlier in July 2002.
 Hong Kong was chosen to host the event following a decision made by IDEC at a meeting held in Bolivia in February 2002.
 Some 42 senior anti-narcotics officers from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Australia, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and the United States met.
 A Hong Kong police internal news letter recently reported that the aim of the conference is to provide a flexible and forward-thinking environment for information sharing and positive action to counter criminal transnational drug traffickers' organized crime .
 The exchanges of intelligence between Hong Kong police and Chinese mainland police are particularly intense.
 A delegation of 11 members of mainland China 's National Narcotics Control Commission recently visited Hong Kong to study how the police here enforce their anti- narcotics laws .
 The team , consisting of 11 people , was chaired by Chen Cunyi , deputy director of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security 's Bureau of Narcotics Control , and was briefed by Hong Kong police on the enforcement actions carried out in Hong Kong , and led by Hong Kong 's Narcotics Bureau head Ip Lau Chuen .
 Hong Kong police also exchanged mutual concerns with China 's National Narcotics Control Commission and discussed a number of issues , including investigations into anti-drug trafficking and money-laundering activities .
 The mainland parties closed their visit after meeting with Hong Kong Deputy Assistant Commissioner of Crime Yam Tat Wing , and discussed further proposals for cooperation in combating cross-border drug trafficking activities .

 Peruvian military documents disclose that former intelligence head Montesinos was linked to drug trafficking.
 The documents signed by a high-ranking former Peruvian army officer and disclosed on 25 July 2002 mention drug trafficking links and could further compromise the situation of former head of Peru's National Intelligence Service Vladimiro Montesinos.
 According to a front-page story in Peru's national daily El Comercio, Montesinos may have authorized drug dealing by military leaders in the Alto Huallaga region to find leaders of the rebel Shining Path and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.
 Alto Huallaga is located northeast of the capital Lima.
 The story is based on a final report by the Attorney General's Office.
 The Attorney General's Office report collected accusations documents handed over by an unnamed Peruvian army general.
 El Comercio said the Scorpion intelligence operation was put into effect in 1992 by the then-president Alberto Fujimori's government to fight terrorism and drug trafficking in the Amazon region.
 Several agents infiltrated the group as part of the planned "Scorpion" event to gather information on the main rebels and drug traffickers' commanders.
 Additionally, transportation of cocaine to cover up the agents was also ordered.
 Montesinos is a close advisor to former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori.
 Fujimori resigned in November over a bribery scandal and is now in prison in Lima on allegations of alleged connections to the scandal.

 Anti-government insurgents in Nepal escalate bombings and murders following end of state of emergency.
 The attack was planned by insurgents during the mid-term parliamentary elections.
 A 9-month-long nationwide state of emergency in Nepal expired on August 28, 2002.
 Violence committed by anti-government insurgents has escalated across Nepal and bomb threats and explosions have occurred throughout the country.
 At least 5 major bomb incidents occurred in the Kathmandu Valley between August 28, 2002 and September 4, 2002.
 On 28 August 2002 a bomb exploded in a supermarket in central Kathmandu injuring 2 people.
 On 29 August 2002 1 soldier was killed by a bomb in the Kathmandu Valley district of Lalitpur.
 2 separate bomb incidents occurred later on 29 August 2002 in the municipality of Lalitpur and a shop in Kathmandu.
 On 4 September 2002 a bomb exploded at a Kathmandu metropolis office.
 Outside the Kathmandu Valley, anti-government guerrillas murdered many activists from the ruling Nepali Congress and other parties and burned or bombed several buildings.
 Underground leaders stated in an interview with the English-language daily The Kathmandu Post that the insurgents will disrupt the mid-term parliamentary elections on November 13, 2002 comprehensively and violently.
 On 29 August 2002 the British embassy in Nepal warned nationals of an increasing anti-government offensive and advised nationals to avoid areas cordoned off by Nepalese security personnel.
 The embassy stated that intelligence assessments suggest that anti-government guerrillas may have prepared a campaign to complement their own country activities in the city.
 The US State Department stated that after the recent bombings the risk to US citizens and interests is heightened because of anti-government insurgents in Nepal particularly outside the Kathmandu Valley.
 The US State Department stated publicly on September 3, 2002 that anti-government insurgents plan new violence before a general strike declared for September 16, 2002.
 The Government of Nepal is considering reimposing a state of emergency to maintain law and order.
 Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba stated that he will consult with the concerned people and parties about the possibility of extending the state of emergency.
 Deuba aborted a planned trip to Johannesburg for the World Summit on Sustainable Development due to tensions and immediately returned to Nepal after a 9-day visit to Europe.
 The Nepal government imposed a state of emergency on November 26, 2001 when anti-government guerrillas unilaterally defied a 4-month-long cease-fire negotiation with the government and attacked army barracks and police posts.

 Several policemen have been killed and wounded by guerrillas in Nepal following the breakdown of peace talks between the guerrillas and the Nepalese government.
 State-run Radio Nepal reported on 20 October 2002 that at least 3 policemen were killed and 19 others wounded when their vehicle was ambushed by anti-government guerrillas in western Nepal on the evening of 19 October 2002.
 Radio Nepal quoted security officials as stating that --
 3 police personnel including an inspector and a sub-inspector were killed when 2 police vehicles moved into the Tikapur area of Kailali district to search for the guerrillas.
 All the policemen killed and wounded were in the first vehicle.
 A vehicle driver was also killed in the ambush.
 Five police personnel are still missing.
 Wounded police personnel were brought to Kathmandu and Nepalgunj for treatment and additional security personnel were mobilized in the area to defend against the guerrillas.
 Anti-government insurgents have increased violent activities across the Himalayan kingdom since a 9-month-long nationwide state of emergency expired at the end of August 2002.
 The Government of Nepal initiated peace talks with the guerrillas in August 2001 to find a peaceful solution to the guerrilla insurgency which has killed more than 5,000 people including policemen, members of the guerrillas and civilians since it began in the Himalayan kingdom in 1996.
 The 3 rounds of talks held have not concluded due to the guerrillas' demands for the establishment of a state in the republic, an interim government and a new constitution rejected by the Nepalese government.
 More than 3700 guerrillas and hundreds of security personnel have been killed since the Nepalese government imposed a state of emergency on November 26, 2001 following a series of attacks by the guerrillas on Nepalese security forces after breaking 4 months-long cease-fire talks with the government on November 23, 2001.

 The recent raid on the People's Mujahedeen in Paris was characterized by the French Foreign Minister as part of the fight against terrorism.
 French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin said on June 3, 2003 that the French government was considering a crackdown on the Iranian armed opposition group the People's Mujahedeen as part of an operation against terrorism.
 de Villepin said on French radio France Info that the People's Mujahedeen claimed responsibility for numerous attacks in Iran and that this dimension of terrorism could not be hidden.
 De Villepin said the arrests were a decision of justice and that there are no diplomatic factors in this affair.
 De Villepin said the French people will act on the basis of strict justice and strictly on the basis of justice in determining all efforts to fight terrorism.
 On 22 June 2003 French police raided the headquarters of the People's Mujahedeen in northwest Paris.
 The People's Mujahedeen accused French authorities of carrying out the operation as part of a deal with the Iranian government.
 The Iranian government denies this claim.
 The judiciary is now investigating 17 members of the Mujahedeen for alleged links to terrorist organizations and funding terrorist activities.
 Some 160 people were initially detained as police cracked down on over 10 of the People's Mujahedeen's locations in France.
 During the police raid a Paris map of streets marked out in the United States embassy, bullet-proof jackets, transmission equipment, more than 200 computers and about 9 million U.S. dollars in cash were seized.
 The People's Mujahedeen is classified as a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union and Iran.
 The People's Mujahedeen was formed in the 1960s by young Iranians educated in college and described as an Islamic left-wing organization.
 The People's Mujahedeen staged terrorist attacks inside Iran in the 1970s and killed several US military personnel and civilians working on defense projects in Teheran.
 The People's Mujahedeen was part of a broad coalition that initially supported the Iranian Revolution and participated in the 1979 takeover of the US embassy in Teheran.
 Since the 1980s the People's Mujahedeen and the government have fallen out and the People's Mujahedeen has been building military bases in Iraq and political bases in Europe.
 In recent years the People's Mujahedeen has claimed responsibility for the assassinations of several people of the Iranian regime.
 These assassinations included the assassination in August 1998 of Assodalah Ladjevardi, former director of Teheran's Evin prison and former Iranian army chief commandant General Ali Sayad Chirazi in April 1999.
